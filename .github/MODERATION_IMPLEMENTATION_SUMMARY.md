  - 8 sub-epics defined
  - 10-week timeline with phases
  - Ban scope requirements emphasized

### Phase 1: Permission Model (EPIC 1)
- **[#1020](https://github.com/subculture-collective/clipper/issues/1020)** - Add Community Moderator Role to Permission Model
- **[#1021](https://github.com/subculture-collective/clipper/issues/1021)** - Add Community Moderation Permissions

### Phase 3: Frontend (EPIC 5)
- **[#1022](https://github.com/subculture-collective/clipper/issues/1022)** - Create useCheckBanStatus Hook for Ban Status Checking
  - **Critical:** Explains ban visibility model and interaction requirements

### Additional Issues
Remaining 34 child issues documented in [CHILD_ISSUES_SPECIFICATIONS.md](.github/CHILD_ISSUES_SPECIFICATIONS.md) and ready to be created as needed.

## ⚠️ Critical Requirement: Ban Scope Clarification

### What the User Emphasized
> "Users are only banned from interacting with communities that they are banned from and not sitewide...if there is a post from a community they are banned from, it should either be invisible or they should just be unable to comment favorite share ect"

### Implementation Decision: OPTION B (Recommended)
- **Posts from banned channels ARE VISIBLE** in user's feed
- **Interaction buttons ARE DISABLED** with tooltip: "You're banned from this community"
- **Ban notice badge shown** prominently on post
- User can view/read but cannot comment, favorite, share, or repost

### Why Option B?
✅ More transparent - user knows content exists
✅ Easier to implement - no feed filtering logic
✅ Better UX - no confusion about missing content
✅ Consistent with platform norms (Reddit, Twitter)
✅ Users can still see what they're missing

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Permission Model
```
Site Admin
├─ Platform-wide permissions
├─ Can issue sitewide bans (is_banned = true)
└─ Can manage all moderators

Site Moderator
├─ Cross-channel visibility
├─ Can view all channel-specific bans
└─ Cannot escalate privileges

Community Moderator (Channel-Scoped)
├─ Can only ban from assigned channels
├─ Bans are ALWAYS channel-specific
├─ Cannot access other channels
└─ Cannot modify permissions
```

### Database Schema
- `community_moderators` table (channel-specific mod assignments)
- `channel_moderators_association` table (track moderator scope)
- `twitch_bans` table (synced ban data with channel_id FK)
- `moderation_audit_logs` table (all actions logged)
- Enhanced User model: `ModeratorScope`, `ModerationChannels`, `ModerationStartedAt`

### Frontend Components
- `ModeratorManager.tsx` - Manage who moderates
- `BanListViewer.tsx` - View/revoke bans
- `SyncBansModal.tsx` - Initiate Twitch sync
- `AuditLogViewer.tsx` - View moderation history
- `useCheckBanStatus` hook - Check ban status per-channel

✅ API contracts specified with ban status in responses
✅ Custom React hook defined for ban checking
✅ Comprehensive test strategy documented
✅ Authorization boundaries enforced at service layer
✅ Ready for agent-based implementation with minimal human intervention

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Review Documentation**
   - Read [MODERATION_ROADMAP.md](.github/MODERATION_ROADMAP.md) for overview
   - Review [CHILD_ISSUES_SPECIFICATIONS.md](.github/CHILD_ISSUES_SPECIFICATIONS.md) for details
   - Check [MODERATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md](.github/MODERATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for reference

2. **Approve Architecture & Ban Scope**
   - Confirm ban scope is channel-specific only
   - Approve OPTION B (visible content, disabled interactions)
   - Review permission model

3. **Create Remaining Child Issues**
   - Remaining 34 issues from [CHILD_ISSUES_SPECIFICATIONS.md](.github/CHILD_ISSUES_SPECIFICATIONS.md)
   - Or use automation to batch create from specification

4. **Begin Phase 1 Development**
   - Start with EPIC 1 (Permission Model - #1020, #1021)
   - Then EPIC 2 (Database Schema)
   - These are blockers for all other work

5. **Assign Team Members**
   - Backend team: EPIC 1-4, 6, 8
   - Frontend team: EPIC 5, 6
   - Testing team: EPIC 6
   - Documentation: EPIC 7

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

1. **Ban Scope:** Always channel-specific (NEVER sitewide except Site Admin)
2. **Visibility:** Posts visible, interactions disabled (not hidden)
3. **Role Separation:** Clear distinction between community and site moderators
4. **API Design:** All responses include `currentUserBanStatus` for each post
5. **Testing:** Comprehensive coverage (unit, integration, E2E)
6. **Audit:** All actions logged with who, what, when, why

## ✅ Ready for Development

This roadmap is **complete and ready for implementation**. All specifications are detailed enough to be given to a development team or agent with minimal human intervention required.
