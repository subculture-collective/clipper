```

### Backend Development

```bash
cd backend

# Run the server
go run cmd/api/main.go

# Build the binary
go build -o bin/api ./cmd/api

# Run tests
go test ./...

# Format code
go fmt ./...
```

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd frontend

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## 📝 API Documentation

The API is organized under `/api/v1` prefix:

- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /api/v1/ping` - API ping endpoint

More endpoints will be documented as they are implemented.

## 🧪 Testing

We have a comprehensive testing strategy covering unit, integration, E2E, and load tests. See [Testing Guide](docs/TESTING.md) for detailed documentation.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run unit tests only
make test-unit

# Run integration tests (requires Docker)
make test-integration

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run load tests (requires k6)
make test-load
```

### Backend Tests

```bash
cd backend

# Unit tests
go test ./...

# With coverage
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out

# With race detection
go test -race ./...
```

### Frontend Tests

```bash
cd frontend

# Unit/integration tests
npm test

# With UI
npm run test:ui

# With coverage
npm run test:coverage

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# E2E with UI
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

### Coverage Status

- **Backend**: ~15% (Target: >80%)
  - JWT: 80% ✓
  - Scheduler: 81.8% ✓
  - Utils: 100% ✓
  - Handlers: 0% (in progress)
  - Services: 4.3% (in progress)
  
- **Frontend**: Infrastructure ready, tests in development

### Performance Targets

- Feed endpoint: <100ms (p95)
- API responses: <50ms (p95)
- Concurrent users: 1000+
- Requests/second: 100+

## 📦 Building for Production

```bash
# Build everything
make build

# Or build individually
make backend-build
make frontend-build
```

## 🐳 Docker

The project includes a `docker-compose.yml` for local development with PostgreSQL and Redis:

```bash
# Start services
docker compose up -d

# Stop services
docker compose down

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Reset database
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d
```

## 🚢 Deployment

### CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

- **CI Workflow**: Runs on every push and PR to `main` and `develop` branches
  - Lints and formats code (backend and frontend)
  - Runs tests with coverage reporting
  - Builds binaries and bundles
  - Matrix testing across Go 1.21/1.22 and Node 18/20

- **Docker Workflow**: Builds and pushes Docker images
  - Multi-stage builds for optimized image sizes
  - Pushes to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
  - Tags with version, branch, and commit SHA
  - Scans images for vulnerabilities with Trivy

- **Security Scanning**:
  - CodeQL analysis for Go and TypeScript
  - Weekly scheduled security scans
  - Automated dependency updates via Dependabot

### Docker Images

Build images locally:

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
docker build -t clipper-backend .

# Frontend
cd frontend
docker build -t clipper-frontend .
```

Pull from GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/subculture-collective/clipper/backend:latest
docker pull ghcr.io/subculture-collective/clipper/frontend:latest
```

### Deployment Environments

#### Staging

- Deploys automatically on push to `develop` branch
- Environment: `staging`
- Runs smoke tests after deployment

To configure staging deployment, add these secrets to your repository:

- `STAGING_HOST`: Hostname of staging server
- `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY`: SSH private key for deployment

#### Production

- Deploys on push to `main` or version tags (`v*`)
- Requires manual approval via GitHub Environments
- Runs E2E tests before deployment
- Automatic rollback on health check failure

To configure production deployment, add these secrets:

- `PRODUCTION_HOST`: Hostname of production server
- `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY`: SSH private key for deployment

### Required Secrets

Configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository settings:

| Secret | Description | Required For |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| `CODECOV_TOKEN` | Codecov upload token | Coverage reporting |
| `STAGING_HOST` | Staging server hostname | Staging deployment |
| `PRODUCTION_HOST` | Production server hostname | Production deployment |
| `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` | SSH key for deployment | Both deployments |

### Manual Deployment

To deploy manually, use workflow dispatch:

```bash
# Via GitHub UI
Actions > Deploy to Staging/Production > Run workflow

# Via GitHub CLI
gh workflow run deploy-staging.yml
gh workflow run deploy-production.yml
```

### Deployment Scripts

The repository includes several deployment automation scripts in the `scripts/` directory:

```bash
# Deploy application with automated backup and health checks
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Rollback to a previous version
./scripts/rollback.sh [backup-tag]

# Run health checks on all services
./scripts/health-check.sh

# Backup database and configuration
./scripts/backup.sh

# Set up SSL/TLS certificates (requires sudo)
sudo ./scripts/setup-ssl.sh
```

See [RUNBOOK.md](./docs/RUNBOOK.md) for detailed operational procedures.
