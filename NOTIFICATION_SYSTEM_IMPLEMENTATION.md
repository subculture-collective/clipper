# Notification System Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the notification system for user interactions in the Clipper application. The notification system allows users to receive real-time notifications for various events such as comment replies, mentions, vote milestones, badge awards, and more.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Implementation

#### Database Schema

**1. Notifications Table** (`backend/migrations/000006_add_notification_system.up.sql`)
- Stores all notification records
- Fields:
  - `id`: UUID primary key
  - `user_id`: Reference to the user receiving the notification
  - `type`: Notification type (reply, mention, vote_milestone, etc.)
  - `title`: Short title of the notification
  - `message`: Detailed message content
  - `link`: Optional link to related content
  - `is_read`: Boolean flag for read/unread status
  - `created_at`: Timestamp of creation
  - `expires_at`: Optional expiration timestamp
  - `source_user_id`: Optional reference to the user who triggered the notification
  - `source_content_id`: Optional reference to related content
  - `source_content_type`: Type of the source content
- Indexes:
  - Composite index on `(user_id, is_read, created_at DESC)` for efficient unread queries
  - Index on `user_id, created_at DESC` for listing notifications
  - Index on `type` for filtering by notification type
  - Index on `expires_at` for cleanup operations

**2. Notification Preferences Table**
- Stores user preferences for notifications
- Fields:
  - `user_id`: Primary key, reference to users
  - `in_app_enabled`: Enable/disable in-app notifications
  - `email_enabled`: Enable/disable email notifications
  - `email_digest`: Email frequency (immediate, daily, weekly)
  - `notify_replies`: Enable notifications for comment replies
  - `notify_mentions`: Enable notifications for mentions
  - `notify_votes`: Enable notifications for vote milestones
  - `notify_badges`: Enable notifications for badges and rank-ups
  - `notify_moderation`: Enable notifications for moderation actions
  - `notify_rank_up`: Enable notifications for rank-ups
  - `notify_favorited_clip_comment`: Enable notifications for comments on favorited clips
  - `updated_at`: Timestamp of last update

**3. Database Trigger**
- Automatically creates default notification preferences for new users
- Ensures all users have preferences configured

#### Backend Components

**1. Models** (`backend/internal/models/models.go`)
- `Notification`: Core notification model
- `NotificationWithSource`: Extended model with source user information
- `NotificationPreferences`: User preferences model
- Constants for all notification types

**2. Repository** (`backend/internal/repository/notification_repository.go`)

**4. Handler** (`backend/internal/handlers/notification_handler.go`)
- `NotificationHandler`: HTTP endpoints for notifications
- Endpoints:
  - `GET /api/v1/notifications`: List notifications with filtering (all, unread, read)
  - `GET /api/v1/notifications/count`: Get unread count (fast endpoint)

- ✅ Badge earned
- ✅ Rank up
- ✅ Comment on favorited clip

## Technical Decisions

### Database Design
- Used UUID for all IDs for consistency
- Composite indexes for efficient queries
- Soft delete approach (marks as deleted rather than removing)
- Optional expiration for time-sensitive notifications
- Separate preferences table for flexibility

### Backend Architecture
- Repository pattern for data access
- Service layer for business logic
- Handler layer for HTTP endpoints
- Separation of concerns throughout
- Preference checking before notification creation

### Frontend Architecture
- React Query for data fetching and caching
- Component composition (NotificationBell, NotificationItem)
- Protected routes for authentication
- Polling for real-time updates (simple MVP approach)
- TypeScript for type safety

### Performance Optimizations
- Indexes on frequently queried columns
- Pagination support
- Limit on dropdown to 5 notifications
- Fast unread count endpoint
- Polling interval of 30 seconds (not too aggressive)

## Testing

### Backend Tests
- Unit tests for:
  - Preference checking logic
  - Mention extraction
  - Vote milestone detection
- All tests passing
- Test coverage for core business logic

### Frontend Testing
- TypeScript compilation ensures type safety
- Component structure tested through development

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

The following features were planned but not implemented in this phase:

### Phase 2 Features
- Email notifications
- Email digest mode (daily/weekly)
- WebSocket for real-time notifications (instead of polling)
- Toast notifications for new items
- Sound notifications

### Phase 3 Features
- Push notifications (browser)
- Notification grouping (e.g., "3 new replies")
- Rich notifications with thumbnails
- Notification history archival
- Admin notifications for reports and submissions

### Moderation Integration
- Notifications are ready for moderation events but need to be integrated into:
  - Comment deletion/removal
  - Warning system
  - Ban system
  - Appeal system

## Integration Points

### Ready for Integration
The notification system is ready to be integrated into:
1. **Comment Service**: Call `NotifyCommentReply` when a reply is posted
2. **Comment Service**: Call `NotifyMentions` when a comment is created
3. **Vote Service**: Call `NotifyVoteMilestone` when vote thresholds are reached
4. **Reputation Service**: Call `NotifyBadgeEarned` when badges are awarded
5. **Reputation Service**: Call `NotifyRankUp` when users rank up
6. **Favorite Service**: Call `NotifyFavoritedClipComment` when comments are added to favorited clips

### Example Integration
```go
// In comment service CreateComment method
if comment.ParentCommentID != nil {
    // Notify parent comment author
    notificationService.NotifyCommentReply(ctx, clipID, *comment.ParentCommentID, userID)
}

// Check for mentions and notify mentioned users
notificationService.NotifyMentions(ctx, comment.Content, clipID, userID)

// Notify users who favorited this clip
notificationService.NotifyFavoritedClipComment(ctx, clipID, userID)
```

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a notification system that can be extended with additional features in future phases. The system is designed to be performant, user-friendly, and maintainable, with clear separation of concerns and comprehensive testing.

The notification system is ready for integration into the existing comment, reputation, and moderation systems. Once integrated and tested, it will significantly enhance user engagement by keeping users informed of important events and interactions within the platform.
