**Issue #989 - Complete Deployment Automation TODOs**
- [x] Automated migration execution (8-12h)
- [x] k6 load test metrics extraction (6-8h)
- [x] Password placeholder validation (4-6h)

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Automated Migration Execution ✅

**Location:** `scripts/blue-green-deploy.sh` (lines 173-238)

**Features Implemented:**
- Pre-flight database connectivity validation using `pg_isready`
- Automated migration execution using `golang-migrate:v4.17.0` Docker container
- Post-migration version verification
- Comprehensive error handling with automatic rollback
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting and audit trails
- Network-isolated execution within Docker network
- Secure credential handling via environment variables

**Key Implementation:**
```bash
# Pre-flight validation
if ! docker exec clipper-postgres pg_isready -U "${POSTGRES_USER:-clipper}" \
     -d "${POSTGRES_DB:-clipper_db}" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    log_error "Database is not ready for migrations"
    return 1
fi

# Execute migrations
docker run --rm \
    --network clipper-network \
    -v "$DEPLOY_DIR/backend/migrations:/migrations:ro" \
    -e DATABASE_URL="$DB_URL" \
    migrate/migrate:v4.17.0 \
    -path /migrations \
    -database "$DATABASE_URL" \
    up
```

**Testing:**
- ✅ Syntax validation passes
- ✅ Pre-flight validation verified
- ✅ Migration execution logic tested
- ✅ Error handling confirmed
- ✅ CI integration ready

---

### 2. k6 Load Test Metrics Extraction ✅

**Location:** `backend/tests/load/run_all_benchmarks.sh` (lines 105-240)

**Features Implemented:**
- JSON output parsing using `jq` for k6 NDJSON format
- Automatic fallback to log file parsing when JSON unavailable
- Comprehensive metrics extraction:
  - p50, p95, p99 response time percentiles
  - Error rate percentage
  - Requests per second (RPS/throughput)
  - Cache hit rate percentage
- Automated Markdown report generation
- CI-ready exit codes (0 = success, 1 = failures detected)
- Trend data output for visualization

**Metrics Table Format:**
```markdown
| Endpoint | Status | p50 | p95 | p99 | Error Rate | RPS | Cache Hit % |
|----------|--------|-----|-----|-----|------------|-----|-------------|
| feed_list | PASS | 18.23ms | 67.45ms | 142.89ms | 0.32% | 52.34 | 73.21% |
```

**Key Implementation:**
```bash
# Extract metrics from k6 JSON output or log file
extract_k6_metrics() {
    local json_file=$1
    local log_file=$2
    
    # Parse k6 JSON using jq
    local summary=$(grep '"type":"Point"' "$json_file" 2>/dev/null | tail -1000)
    
    # Calculate percentiles, error rates, throughput
    local p50=$(echo "$summary" | jq -s '...' 2>/dev/null | xargs printf "%.2f")
    # ... (additional metric extraction logic)
    
    # Fallback to log parsing if JSON unavailable
    if [[ "$p50" == "0.00" ]] || [[ -z "$p50" ]]; then
        p50=$(grep -oP "p50:\s+\K[\d.]+" "$log_file" 2>/dev/null | tail -1)
    fi
}
```

**Testing:**
- ✅ Syntax validation passes
- ✅ JSON parsing verified with real k6 output
- ✅ Log fallback tested
- ✅ Report generation confirmed
- ✅ All metrics correctly extracted

---

### 3. Password Placeholder Validation ✅

**Location:** `scripts/validate-hardening.sh` (lines 51-120)

**Features Implemented:**
- CHANGEME placeholder requirement for example files
- Sensitive variable detection (PASSWORD, SECRET, KEY, TOKEN patterns)
- Intelligent false positive filtering for configuration variables
- Production environment validation (no CHANGEME allowed in prod)
- Multi-file support (.env.production.example, .env.staging.example)
- Clear error reporting with specific variable names

**Validation Rules:**

**Example Files (.env.*.example):**
- ✅ Must contain CHANGEME for sensitive variables
- ✅ Should not have hardcoded secrets
- ✅ Configuration values (ports, timeouts) are acceptable

**Production Files (.env.production, .env):**
- ✅ Must NOT contain CHANGEME placeholders
- ✅ Fails validation if CHANGEME found
- ✅ Lists specific variables requiring updates

**Excluded Patterns:**
```bash
EXPIRY, EXPIRES, TTL, TIMEOUT, DURATION, INTERVAL,
MAX, MIN, LIMIT, PORT, HOST, URL, ENABLE, DISABLE
```

**Key Implementation:**
```bash
validate_env_placeholders() {
    local env_file=$1
    local is_actual_env=${2:-false}
    
    # For example files, ensure CHANGEME placeholders are present
    if [[ "$env_file" == *.example ]]; then
        local critical_vars=("PASSWORD" "SECRET" "KEY" "TOKEN")
        for pattern in "${critical_vars[@]}"; do
            # Check each variable, excluding false positives
            if [[ ${var_name^^} == *"$pattern"* ]]; then
                # Validate CHANGEME or empty value
            fi
        done
    fi
    
    # For production, ensure no CHANGEME remains
    if [ "$is_actual_env" = true ]; then
        if grep -v '^[[:space:]]*#' "$env_file" | grep -q "CHANGEME"; then
            print_test "FAIL" "Production still contains CHANGEME!"
            return 1
        fi
    fi
}
```

**Testing:**
- ✅ Syntax validation passes
- ✅ Validation function verified
- ✅ CHANGEME detection confirmed
- ✅ False positive filtering tested
- ✅ Production validation logic verified
