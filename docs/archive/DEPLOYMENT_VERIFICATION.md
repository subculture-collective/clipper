# Deployment Verification - December 7, 2025

## Status: ✅ DEPLOYED AND VERIFIED

The React chunking fix has been successfully deployed to production.

## What Was Fixed

**Problem:** React library was being loaded in a separate chunk that could race with the main app chunk, causing "Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'Activity')" error.

**Solution:** Modified Vite configuration to bundle React with the main app chunk instead of splitting it into a separate vendor chunk.

## Deployment Summary

### Frontend Build

- **Build Date:** December 7, 2025 @ 17:56 UTC
- **Bundle Name:** `app-UlI5Uk2Z.js`
- **Bundle Size:** 518 KB (164.93 KB gzipped)
- **Contents:** React 19.2.0 + App code + essential dependencies (all bundled together)
- **Chunking Strategy:** Only heavy optional dependencies (recharts, markdown, lodash) split out

### Docker Container Status

- **Image:** `clipper-frontend:latest` (rebuilt Dec 7 18:16 UTC)
- **Container:** `clipper-frontend` (running on web network, port 80 internal)
- **Health Status:** ✅ Healthy
- **Reverse Proxy:** Caddy (clpr.tv → clipper-frontend:80)

### Verification Results

✅ **Bundle File Verification**
- Container serving: `app-UlI5Uk2Z.js`
- Expected bundle: `app-UlI5Uk2Z.js`
- **Result: MATCH**

✅ **Network Connectivity**
- Caddy can reach frontend: `curl http://clipper-frontend/` → Returns HTML with correct bundle
- Frontend container is on: `web` network (same as Caddy reverse proxy)
- **Result: WORKING**

✅ **Caddy Reverse Proxy**
- Config location: `/home/onnwee/projects/caddy/conf.d/clpr.tv.caddy`
- Frontend route: `reverse_proxy clipper-frontend:80`
- **Result: CONFIGURED**

## How to Verify in Browser

1. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (macOS)
   - Select "All time" and clear cache

2. **Hard Refresh**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (macOS)
   - This forces the browser to fetch new files from the server

3. **Verify the Fix**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Reload the page
   - Look for `app-UlI5Uk2Z.js` in the list (should be ~518 KB)
   - You should NOT see separate React chunks like:
     - `vendor-*.js` with React
     - `react-vendor-*.js`
   - Check Console tab for any errors (should be none)

## Technical Details

### Changed Files

1. **frontend/Dockerfile**
   - Updated to work with project root context
   - Correctly copies files from `frontend/` subdirectory
   - Builds with `npm run build` which uses Vite config

2. **frontend/vite.config.ts**
   - Uses smart `manualChunks` strategy
   - React bundled with main app chunk
   - Only optional heavy dependencies split out
   - Prevents race conditions between React and app initialization

### Related Fixes Applied Earlier

1. **Database Migrations:** All 27 migrations now pass (fixed pgvector, pg_trgm extensions and SQL syntax)
2. **Docker Infrastructure:** Updated postgres with custom image for pgvector support

## Rollback Instructions (if needed)

```bash
# If issues arise, the old container is still available as:
# - Build without changes: docker build -f frontend/Dockerfile.bak -t clipper-frontend:previous /path/to/clipper
# - Or rebuild from git: git checkout HEAD~1 -- frontend/vite.config.ts && docker build ...

# Current safe state:
docker ps  # Shows: clipper-frontend running with new image
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ All code is deployed
2. ✅ Docker container is running
3. ✅ Caddy reverse proxy is configured
4. → User needs to clear browser cache and hard refresh to see the fix in action

**Expected outcome after browser refresh:**
- Single `app-UlI5Uk2Z.js` bundle loads
- No "Cannot set properties of undefined" errors
- App initializes correctly
- All features work as expected
