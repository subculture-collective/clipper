# Deployment Improvements Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Chunking Issue (Root Cause)

**Problem:** Frontend bundled into single large file → loading timeouts

**Fix:** Updated [frontend/vite.config.ts](frontend/vite.config.ts)
- Removed `inlineDynamicImports: true`
- Enabled `cssCodeSplit: true`
- Added intelligent `manualChunks` strategy
- Results: Smaller initial bundles, parallel chunk loading

**How to deploy the fix:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install  # Ensure dependencies are current
npm run build  # Verify build completes without errors
# Then deploy using blue-green (see below)
```

### 2. ✅ Zero-Downtime Deployments

**New File:** [docker-compose.blue-green.yml](docker-compose.blue-green.yml)
- Supports running BLUE (current) and GREEN (new) simultaneously
- Shared PostgreSQL and Redis
- Traffic switches without downtime

**New Script:** [scripts/deploy-blue-green.sh](scripts/deploy-blue-green.sh)
- Automated deployment orchestration
- Health checks before traffic switch
- Rollback capability
- Manual approval step for safety

**Usage:**
```bash
bash scripts/deploy-blue-green.sh
# Script handles entire deployment automatically
```

### 3. ✅ Traffic Management

**New Script:** [scripts/blue-green-traffic.sh](scripts/blue-green-traffic.sh)
- Manual traffic switching
- Health checks
- Status monitoring

**Usage:**
```bash
# Check status
sudo bash scripts/blue-green-traffic.sh status

# Switch traffic
sudo bash scripts/blue-green-traffic.sh switch green

# Verify health
sudo bash scripts/blue-green-traffic.sh check
```

### 4. ✅ Live Development Workflow

**New Guide:** [docs/development-workflow.md](docs/development-workflow.md)
- Three-branch system: `main` (production), `develop` (staging), `feature/*`
- Automatic deployments: develop→staging, main→production
- Feature development without disrupting production
- PR-based code review

**Quick start:**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature develop
# ... work locally with `make dev` ...
git push origin feature/my-feature
# Create PR to develop (auto-deploys to staging)
# After review, merge to develop
# When ready, create PR develop→main (auto-deploys to production)
```

### 5. ✅ Deployment & Monitoring Guide

**New Guide:** [docs/deployment-live-development.md](docs/deployment-live-development.md)
- Complete deployment procedures
- Troubleshooting guide
- Nginx configuration examples
- Health check procedures
- Recovery checklists

### 6. ✅ Nginx Configuration

**New File:** [nginx/blue-green.conf](nginx/blue-green.conf)
- Blue-green deployment setup
- Traffic routing to active environment
- SSL/TLS configuration example
- Health check endpoints

### 7. ✅ Enhanced Health Checks

**Updated:** [scripts/health-check.sh](scripts/health-check.sh)
- Backend and frontend health
- Chunk loading verification
- Response time checks
- Docker container status
- Blue-green environment status

**Usage:**
```bash
# Basic check
bash scripts/health-check.sh

# Detailed check with chunk inspection
VERBOSE=true CHECK_CHUNKS=true bash scripts/health-check.sh

# Monitor specific environment
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8081 bash scripts/health-check.sh
```

## Deployment Workflow

### For Development

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/fix-thing develop

# 2. Test locally
make dev  # Runs docker-up, backend-dev, frontend-dev

# 3. Push and PR
git push origin feature/fix-thing
# Create PR: feature/fix-thing -> develop

# 4. Automatic staging deployment
# (happens on develop merge)

# 5. Promote to production
# Create PR: develop -> main
# (automatic production deployment on main merge)
```

### For Production Deployment

```bash
# Option A: Automatic (via GitHub Actions)
# After merging to main, deployment starts automatically

# Option B: Manual blue-green deployment
bash scripts/deploy-blue-green.sh

# Option C: Manual step-by-step
docker-compose -f docker-compose.blue-green.yml --profile green up -d backend-green frontend-green
sleep 30
bash scripts/health-check.sh
sudo bash scripts/blue-green-traffic.sh switch green
docker-compose -f docker-compose.blue-green.yml down backend-blue frontend-blue
```

## How to Get Started

### 1. Fix the Chunking Issue Now

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build  # Verify no errors
# Check dist/assets/ has multiple chunk files
ls dist/assets/ | grep -E "chunk|vendor"
```

### 2. Set Up Blue-Green Locally (Optional)

```bash
# Start blue environment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.blue-green.yml up -d postgres redis backend-blue frontend-blue

# Verify
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:80

# Check logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.blue-green.yml logs -f
```

### 3. Configure Nginx on VPS

```bash
# Copy blue-green config
sudo cp nginx/blue-green.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/clipper
sudo ln -sf /etc/nginx/sites-available/clipper /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

# Set active environment
echo "blue" | sudo tee /etc/nginx/active_env

# Test and reload
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### 4. Test Deployment

```bash
# Check current status
bash scripts/health-check.sh

# Try blue-green deployment
bash scripts/deploy-blue-green.sh
# Follow prompts, can safely decline at approval step to test
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Frontend builds without errors: `cd frontend && npm run build`
- [ ] Bundle is chunked: Check `dist/assets/` for multiple `chunk-*.js` files
- [ ] Health checks pass: `bash scripts/health-check.sh`
- [ ] Docker blue-green setup works: Can start both environments
- [ ] Nginx blue-green config in place
- [ ] Development workflow guide reviewed
- [ ] Team understands new deployment process

## Key Benefits

1. **No More Downtime** - Blue-green deployment keeps service running during updates
2. **Chunking Fixed** - Faster initial load, parallel chunk downloads
3. **Safe Development** - Feature branches don't affect production
4. **Automatic Deployments** - Develop→staging, main→production
5. **Quick Rollback** - One command to revert to previous version
6. **Better Monitoring** - Enhanced health checks for troubleshooting
