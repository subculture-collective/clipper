## Security Features

### Secret Management
- Secrets are 32-byte cryptographically secure random values
- Secrets are only shown once upon creation or regeneration
- Secrets should be stored securely by the webhook consumer
- Secrets are used for HMAC-SHA256 signature verification

### SSRF Protection
- Webhook URLs are validated to prevent Server-Side Request Forgery
- Private IP ranges and localhost are blocked
- Only HTTP and HTTPS schemes are allowed

### Rate Limiting
- Create webhook: 10 requests per hour
- Regenerate secret: 5 requests per hour
- Get events: 60 requests per minute

## Webhook Payload Format

Webhooks are sent as POST requests with the following format:

```json
{
  "event": "clip.submitted",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "submission_id": "uuid",
    "clip_id": "uuid",
    "user_id": "uuid",
    // ... additional event-specific data
  }
}
```

### Signature Verification

Each webhook request includes an `X-Webhook-Signature` header containing an HMAC-SHA256 signature. You must verify this signature to ensure the webhook is authentic.

**Important:** See the [Webhook Signature Verification Guide](./WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_VERIFICATION.md) for:
- Detailed explanation of the signature verification process
- Complete code examples in 7+ programming languages (Node.js, Python, Go, Ruby, PHP, Java, C#)
- Working test servers you can run locally
- Sample payloads with pre-computed signatures
- Security best practices and troubleshooting

Quick example (Node.js):

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifySignature(payload, signature, secret) {
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret);
  hmac.update(payload);
  const expectedSignature = hmac.digest('hex');
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(signature),
    Buffer.from(expectedSignature)
  );
}
```

## Delivery Guarantees

### Retry Logic
- Failed deliveries are automatically retried with exponential backoff
- Maximum 5 retry attempts
- Retry intervals: 30s, 60s, 120s, 240s, 480s
- After exhausting all retries, deliveries are moved to the dead-letter queue (DLQ)

### Delivery Status
- **pending**: Delivery is scheduled or in progress
- **delivered**: Successfully delivered (HTTP 2xx response)
- **failed**: All retry attempts exhausted (moved to DLQ)

### Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ)
When a webhook delivery fails after all retry attempts, it is moved to the dead-letter queue. Administrators can:
- View all failed deliveries in the admin panel at `/admin/webhooks/dlq`
- Inspect the full payload and error details
- Manually replay failed deliveries to retry them
- Delete entries that are no longer needed

**Admin Features:**
- **View DLQ**: See all permanently failed webhook deliveries
- **Replay**: Attempt to redeliver a failed webhook
- **Delete**: Remove entries from the DLQ
- **Audit Trail**: Track replay attempts and their success/failure status

### Audit Log
The delivery history provides a complete audit log including:
- Event type and timestamp
- HTTP status code
- Response body (truncated)
- Error messages
- Retry count
- Delivery status

## Best Practices

1. **Verify Signatures**: Always verify the webhook signature before processing
2. **Handle Idempotency**: Use event IDs to prevent duplicate processing
3. **Respond Quickly**: Return 2xx status within 10 seconds
4. **Secure Your Endpoint**: Use HTTPS and validate requests
5. **Monitor Deliveries**: Check delivery history regularly
6. **Rotate Secrets**: Periodically regenerate secrets for security
7. **Handle Failures**: Implement proper error handling and logging

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Receiving Events
1. Check that the subscription is active
2. Verify the URL is correct and accessible
3. Check delivery history for error messages
4. Ensure your endpoint responds within 10 seconds
5. Verify you're subscribed to the correct events
6. **If deliveries are in DLQ**: Check admin panel for failed deliveries and replay them after fixing issues

### Authentication Failures
1. Verify signature verification is implemented correctly
2. Ensure you're using the current secret
3. Check that the payload hasn't been modified

### Persistent Failures
If webhooks consistently fail and appear in the DLQ:
1. **Check endpoint availability**: Ensure your webhook endpoint is accessible from the internet
2. **Review error messages**: Check the DLQ for specific error details
3. **Verify SSL/TLS**: Ensure your endpoint has a valid SSL certificate
4. **Check response time**: Webhooks must respond within 10 seconds
5. **Fix and replay**: After resolving issues, use the admin panel to replay failed deliveries

### Rate Limiting
If you hit rate limits:
1. Reduce creation frequency
2. Implement exponential backoff
3. Cache supported events list

### Monitoring and Observability
For production deployments:
1. **Monitor DLQ size**: Keep track of failed deliveries
2. **Set up alerts**: Get notified when DLQ items exceed threshold
3. **Review regularly**: Check admin panel periodically for patterns
4. **Track replay success**: Monitor whether replayed webhooks succeed
