- ✅ Updated backend README with setup guide
- ✅ Inline code documentation

## 📊 Database Schema Highlights

### Key Features

1. **UUID Primary Keys** - Prevents enumeration attacks
2. **Cascade Deletes** - Maintains referential integrity
3. **Denormalized Counts** - Fast reads for engagement metrics
4. **Hot Score Algorithm** - Time-decay ranking like Reddit
5. **Nested Comments** - Self-referencing for threaded discussions
6. **Polymorphic Reports** - Flexible moderation system
7. **Connection Pooling** - Optimized for high concurrency

### Performance Considerations

- **Indexes**: 28 indexes covering all common query patterns
- **Views**: Pre-defined queries for feed generation
- **Triggers**: Automatic metric updates without application code
- **Pool Config**: 25 max connections, health checks every minute
- **Connection Timeout**: 5 seconds for fast failure

### Security Features

- ✅ No SQL injection vulnerabilities (using parameterized queries)
- ✅ UUID keys prevent ID enumeration
- ✅ Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity
- ✅ Role-based access control ready (user/moderator/admin)
- ✅ CodeQL security scan passed with 0 alerts

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Migration Testing

- ✅ Up migration: All tables, indexes, triggers, views created
- ✅ Down migration: Clean rollback, all objects removed
- ✅ Re-migration: Can run up/down/up without issues
- ✅ Seed data: Sample data loads successfully

### Application Testing

- ✅ Database connection pool initializes correctly
- ✅ Health check endpoint verifies connectivity
- ✅ Stats endpoint shows pool metrics
- ✅ Graceful shutdown closes connections properly
- ✅ All Go code compiles without errors

### Sample Data Verification

```
Users: 4 (user, moderator, admin roles)
Clips: 4 (with varying vote scores and engagement)
Tags: 8 (with automatic usage counting)
Votes: 9 (automatic score calculation working)
Comments: 5 (automatic clip comment_count working)
Favorites: 5 (automatic clip favorite_count working)
```

All triggers verified working:

- Vote scores update automatically ✅
- Comment counts update automatically ✅
- Favorite counts update automatically ✅
- Tag usage counts update automatically ✅
- Timestamps update automatically ✅

## 🎓 Next Steps

The database schema is now production-ready. Recommended next steps:

1. **Repository Layer** - Create database access layer using the models
2. **Authentication** - Implement Twitch OAuth flow
3. **API Endpoints** - Build REST endpoints for CRUD operations
4. **Validation** - Add input validation middleware
5. **Rate Limiting** - Protect against abuse
6. **Caching** - Add Redis layer for hot data
7. **Testing** - Write unit and integration tests

## 📖 Usage

### Starting the Database

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Running Migrations

```bash
make migrate-up
make migrate-seed  # Optional: load sample data
```

### Starting the Backend

```bash
cd backend
go run cmd/api/main.go
```

### Health Checks

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health/ready
# {"status":"ready","checks":{"database":"ok"}}
```

## 🔐 Security Summary
