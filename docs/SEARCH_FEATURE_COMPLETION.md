## Not Implemented (Future Enhancements)

The following features from the original issue are marked for future implementation:

### Phase 2 Features
- [ ] Elasticsearch integration
- [ ] Advanced search operators (quotes, field-specific, exclusions)
- [ ] Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- [ ] Fuzzy matching for typos
- [ ] Synonym support
- [ ] Spell correction ("Did you mean?")
- [ ] Voice search
- [ ] Search history (localStorage)
- [ ] Trending searches widget
- [ ] Search analytics dashboard for admins
- [ ] Advanced filters panel (collapsible sidebar)

### Reasoning for Phase 2
These features were intentionally deferred to focus on delivering a solid, production-ready MVP of the search functionality. The current implementation provides:
1. Fast and accurate search results
2. User-friendly autocomplete
3. Essential filtering capabilities
4. Analytics foundation for future improvements

The Phase 2 features can be added incrementally without major architectural changes to the current implementation.

## Testing Performed

1. **Backend Build**: ✅ Successful compilation
2. **Backend Tests**: ✅ All tests pass (including new search repository tests)
3. **Frontend Build**: ✅ Successful build with no errors
4. **Security Scan**: ✅ CodeQL analysis found 0 vulnerabilities
5. **Type Safety**: ✅ Full TypeScript type coverage
