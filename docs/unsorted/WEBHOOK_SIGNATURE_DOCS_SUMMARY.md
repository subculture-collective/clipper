- Troubleshooting guide with common mistakes
- Links to additional resources

### 2. Working Test Servers

**Directory:** `examples/webhooks/`

#### Node.js Express Server
- Full signature verification implementation
- Idempotency handling (prevents duplicate processing)
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Health check endpoint
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Complete setup instructions
- **Status:** ✅ Tested and verified working

#### Python Flask Server  
- Full signature verification implementation
- Idempotency handling (prevents duplicate processing)
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Health check endpoint
- Signal handling for graceful shutdown
- Complete setup instructions
- **Status:** ✅ Tested and verified working

### 3. Test Tools

#### Pre-Computed Test Payloads
**Directory:** `examples/webhooks/test-payloads/`

- `clip-submitted.json` - Clip submission event
- `clip-approved.json` - Clip approval event
- `clip-rejected.json` - Clip rejection event
- All with correctly computed HMAC-SHA256 signatures
- Test secret: `test-secret-key-12345`

#### Automated Test Script
**File:** `examples/webhooks/test-payloads/send-test-webhook.sh`

Features:
- Automatically computes correct signatures
- Sends webhooks to any URL
- Supports all event types
- UUID generation with multiple fallbacks
- Colored output for easy reading
- Detailed error messages
- **Status:** ✅ Tested and verified working

### 4. Documentation Updates

Updated existing documentation with links to new resources:

1. **`docs/WEBHOOK_SUBSCRIPTION_MANAGEMENT.md`**
   - Added "Quick Links" section at top
   - Enhanced signature verification section
   - Links to comprehensive guide
   - Links to working examples

2. **`README.md`**
   - Added links to new webhook documentation
   - Highlighted new signature verification guide
   - Added links to working examples

## Testing & Verification

All deliverables have been thoroughly tested:

### Signature Verification Tests
✅ Valid signatures accepted by both servers
✅ Invalid signatures properly rejected with 401
✅ Timing-safe comparison prevents timing attacks
✅ Raw request body correctly used (not parsed JSON)

### Idempotency Tests
✅ First delivery processed successfully
✅ Duplicate delivery (same ID) skipped
✅ Response indicates "already_processed"

### Signature Computation Tests
✅ All pre-computed signatures mathematically verified
✅ Test script generates correct signatures
✅ Example signatures in documentation verified

### Integration Tests
✅ Test script successfully sends webhooks
✅ Node.js server receives and processes webhooks
✅ Python server receives and processes webhooks
✅ All event types (submitted, approved, rejected) handled

## Quality Assurance

### Code Review
- ✅ All code review feedback addressed
- ✅ Pre-computed signatures corrected
- ✅ UUID generation optimized
- ✅ Status code checking improved

### Security Scan
- ✅ CodeQL security scan passed
- ✅ Expected alert about rate limiting in example server (documented)
- ✅ Security notes added to example READMEs
- ✅ Production guidance provided

### Documentation Quality
- ✅ Clear and comprehensive
- ✅ Multiple language examples
- ✅ Security best practices included
- ✅ Troubleshooting guide provided
- ✅ Cross-references between docs

## Developer Experience

Developers can now:

1. **Learn** from comprehensive guide with detailed explanations
2. **Choose** their preferred language from 7+ examples
3. **Test** locally with working test servers in minutes
4. **Verify** their implementation with pre-computed test signatures
5. **Debug** using the test script and detailed logging
6. **Deploy** confidently following security best practices
