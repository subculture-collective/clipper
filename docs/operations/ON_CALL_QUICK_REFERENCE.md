## Common Alert Response Checklist

### When You Receive an Alert

- [ ] **Acknowledge** in PagerDuty (within 15 min for P1)
- [ ] **Post in #incidents:** "I'm responding to [Alert Name]"
- [ ] **Open dashboards:** Check SLO dashboard and metrics
- [ ] **Assess impact:** How many users? What functionality?
- [ ] **Follow runbook:** Use playbook for specific alert type

### Investigation Quick Commands

```bash
# Check service health
kubectl get pods -n clipper
docker-compose ps

# View recent logs
kubectl logs -l app=backend --tail=100 -n clipper
{service="clipper-backend", level="error"} [15m]  # Loki

# Check database
psql $POSTGRES_URL -c "SELECT 1"
psql -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;"

# Check Redis
redis-cli PING
redis-cli INFO stats

# Recent deployments
kubectl rollout history deployment/backend -n clipper
```

### Common Mitigation Actions

**Rollback deployment:**
```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/backend -n clipper
```

**Scale up:**
```bash
kubectl scale deployment backend --replicas=5 -n clipper
```

**Restart service:**
```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment/backend -n clipper
```

**Clear cache:**
```bash
redis-cli FLUSHDB
```

## SLO Targets (Know These!)

| SLO | Target | Alert Threshold |
|-----|--------|----------------|
| **Availability** | 99.5% | < 99.5% for 5 min |
| **Error Rate** | < 0.5% | > 0.5% for 5 min |
| **Latency (List)** | P95 < 100ms | > 100ms for 5 min |
| **Latency (Detail)** | P95 < 50ms | > 50ms for 5 min |
| **Search** | P95 < 200ms | > 200ms for 5 min |
| **Webhooks** | > 90% success | < 90% for 10 min |

## Alert Type Quick Guide

### 🚨 SLOAvailabilityBreach
- **Meaning:** Less than 99.5% of requests succeeding
- **Check:** Service health, error logs, recent deployments
- **Actions:** Rollback, scale up, restart unhealthy pods
- **Runbook:** [Availability SLO Breach](../../docs/operations/playbooks/slo-breach-response.md#availability-slo-breach)

### 🚨 SLOErrorRateBreach
- **Meaning:** More than 0.5% of requests returning 5xx errors
- **Check:** Error logs, stack traces, database connectivity
- **Actions:** Rollback, fix database connections, hotfix
- **Runbook:** [Error Rate SLO Breach](../../docs/operations/playbooks/slo-breach-response.md#error-rate-slo-breach)

### 🚨 SLOLatencyBreach
- **Meaning:** P95 response time exceeds target
- **Check:** Slow endpoints, database queries, cache hit rate
- **Actions:** Add indexes, scale database, optimize queries
- **Runbook:** [Latency SLO Breach](../../docs/operations/playbooks/slo-breach-response.md#latency-slo-breach)

### 🚨 ServiceDown
- **Meaning:** Service not responding to health checks
- **Check:** Pod status, container logs, crashes

### ⚠️ ErrorBudgetFastBurn

- **Check:** Recent changes, error patterns, traffic spikes
- **Actions:** Immediate mitigation to stop budget burn
- **Runbook:** [SLO Breach Response](../../docs/operations/playbooks/slo-breach-response.md)

### ⚠️ HighErrorRate
- **Meaning:** Error rate elevated but below SLO breach
- **Check:** Error logs, specific endpoints, error types
- **Actions:** Monitor, investigate, prepare mitigation
- **Runbook:** [High Error Rate](../../docs/operations/runbook.md#high-error-rate)

### ⚠️ HighResponseTime
- **Meaning:** Response times elevated
- **Check:** Slow queries, high load, resource usage
- **Actions:** Optimize queries, scale if needed
- **Runbook:** [High Latency](../../docs/operations/runbook.md#high-latency)

### 🛡️ Security Alerts
- **Meaning:** Suspicious activity detected
- **Check:** Security logs, IP addresses, attack patterns
- **Actions:** Block IPs, notify security team, verify input validation
- **Runbook:** [Security Incidents](../../docs/operations/playbooks/slo-breach-response.md)
