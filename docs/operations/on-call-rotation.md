| Week 1 (Jan 1-7) | Engineer A | Engineer B | Manager X |
| Week 2 (Jan 8-14) | Engineer B | Engineer C | Manager X |
| Week 3 (Jan 15-21) | Engineer C | Engineer D | Manager Y |
| Week 4 (Jan 22-28) | Engineer D | Engineer A | Manager Y |

**Note:** Update this table with actual names and maintain in PagerDuty schedule.

### Role Definitions

**Primary On-Call:**
- First responder to all alerts
- Acknowledges alerts within response time SLA
- Leads incident response
- Updates incident channels
- Files incident reports

**Secondary On-Call (Backup):**
- Covers if primary is unavailable
- Auto-escalated after 15 minutes (P1) or 1 hour (P2)
- Assists with complex incidents
- Takes over if primary needs break

**On-Call Manager:**
- Escalation point for critical issues
- Auto-escalated after 30 minutes
- Provides technical leadership
- Makes rollback/architecture decisions
- Coordinates with product/business

## Response Times and SLAs

### Alert Severity Levels

| Severity | Response Time | Acknowledgment | Resolution Target | Escalation |
|----------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|------------|
| **P1 (Critical)** | < 15 minutes | Required | 1 hour | Auto after 15 min |
| **P2 (Warning)** | < 1 hour | Required | 4 hours | Auto after 1 hour |
| **P3 (Info)** | < 4 hours | Optional | 24 hours | No auto-escalation |

### Escalation Path

```
Level 1: Primary On-Call Engineer (0-15 min)
         ↓ (if no ack or needs help)
Level 2: Secondary On-Call Engineer (15-30 min)
         ↓ (if not resolved)
Level 3: On-Call Manager (30-60 min)
         ↓ (if critical/widespread)
Level 4: VP Engineering + CTO (1+ hour)
```

## Incident Response Workflow

### 1. Alert Received

```
RECEIVE ALERT
    ↓
ACKNOWLEDGE in PagerDuty (< 15 min for P1)
    ↓
POST in #incidents: "I'm responding to [Alert Name]"
    ↓
ASSESS IMPACT: Check dashboards, metrics, logs
    ↓
FOLLOW RUNBOOK for specific alert type
    ↓
MITIGATE or ESCALATE
    ↓
RESOLVE and DOCUMENT
```

### 2. Assessment Questions

When you receive an alert, answer these questions:
- What is alerting? (Service, component, metric)
- What is the severity? (P1, P2, P3)
- What is the impact? (Users affected, functionality)
- Is this a known issue? (Check recent incidents)
- What changed recently? (Deployments, config)

### 3. Initial Response Template

Post immediately in #incidents:
```
🚨 Incident: [Alert Name]
Status: Investigating
Started: [Time]
Severity: [P1/P2/P3]
Impact: [Brief description - e.g., "API endpoints returning 5xx"]
Responder: @[your-name]
Dashboard: [Link to relevant Grafana dashboard]

Updates every 15 minutes
```

### 4. Investigation Checklist

- [ ] Check SLO dashboard for current status
- [ ] Review error logs in Loki/Grafana
- [ ] Check recent deployments/changes
- [ ] Verify service health (pods, containers)
- [ ] Check database and Redis status
- [ ] Review metrics for anomalies
- [ ] Follow alert-specific runbook

### 5. Common Mitigation Actions

**Service Issues:**
```bash
# Restart service
kubectl rollout restart deployment/backend -n clipper

# Scale up
kubectl scale deployment backend --replicas=5 -n clipper

# Rollback deployment
kubectl rollout undo deployment/backend -n clipper
```

**Database Issues:**
```bash
# Check connections
psql -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;"

# Check slow queries
psql -c "SELECT query, now() - query_start as duration FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active' ORDER BY duration DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

**Cache Issues:**
```bash
# Check Redis
redis-cli PING
redis-cli INFO stats

# Clear cache (use with caution)
redis-cli FLUSHDB
```

### 6. Status Updates

Post updates every **15 minutes for P1**, **30 minutes for P2**:
```
📊 Update [Time]
Status: [Investigating/Mitigating/Resolving/Resolved]
Actions taken: [List what you've done]
Next steps: [What you're doing next]
Current impact: [Updated impact status]
ETA: [If known]
```

### 7. Resolution and Close

When resolved:
```
✅ Resolved [Time]
Duration: [HH:MM]
Root cause: [Brief description]
Resolution: [What fixed it]
Follow-up: Post-mortem scheduled for [Date/Time]

Service metrics back to normal. Monitoring for 30 minutes before closing.
```

## Silencing Alerts

### When to Silence

**Valid reasons:**
- Scheduled maintenance
- Known issue being actively worked
- Deployment in progress
- Planned downtime

**Invalid reasons:**
- Alert is annoying
- Too many alerts
- Don't know how to fix

### How to Silence

**Via Alertmanager UI:**
1. Go to Alertmanager: http://localhost:9093
2. Click "Silences" tab
3. Click "New Silence"
4. Set matchers (alertname, service, etc.)
5. Set duration (be conservative)
6. Add comment explaining why
7. Add your name/email as creator

**Via CLI:**
```bash
# Silence specific service (RECOMMENDED)
amtool silence add service=backend \
  --duration=2h \
  --comment="Backend deployment in progress" \
  --author="ops@clipper.app"

# Silence specific alert
amtool silence add alertname=HighMemoryUsage \
  --duration=1h \
  --comment="Investigating memory leak" \
  --author="you@clipper.app"

# List active silences
amtool silence query

# Remove silence
amtool silence expire <silence-id>
```

**⚠️ Important:**
- Always add a comment explaining why
- Use shortest duration possible
- Never silence security alerts without manager approval
- Remove silence when issue is resolved

### Silence Guidelines

| Alert Type | Max Silence Duration | Approval Required |
|------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Security | Not recommended | Manager + Security team |
| P1 Critical | 1 hour | Manager |
| P2 Warning | 4 hours | No |
| P3 Info | 24 hours | No |
| Maintenance | Duration of maintenance | Manager for >4h |

## Best Practices

### Do's ✅

- **Acknowledge alerts promptly** (within SLA)
- **Post status updates** regularly
- **Follow runbooks** - they're tested
- **Ask for help** when stuck - escalate!
- **Document everything** - helps with post-mortems
- **Keep team informed** - communication is key
- **Test before your shift** - verify PagerDuty works
- **Learn from incidents** - update runbooks
- **Stay calm** - panic doesn't help

### Don'ts ❌

- **Don't ignore alerts** - even if they seem minor
- **Don't silence without reason** - especially security
- **Don't make changes without understanding** - ask first
- **Don't skip post-mortems** - we learn from failures
- **Don't work alone on P1s** - get help early
- **Don't forget to eat/sleep** - escalate if tired
- **Don't hesitate to rollback** - safety first
- **Don't leave incidents undocumented** - always file reports

## On-Call Compensation

## FAQs

**Q: What if I miss an alert?**
A: It will auto-escalate to secondary. Acknowledge ASAP and post in #incidents explaining the delay.

**Q: Should I page someone at 3 AM?**
A: For P1 incidents, yes. That's what we're here for. For P2, assess if it can wait until morning.

**Q: What if I'm not sure what to do?**
A: Follow the runbook. If still unsure, escalate to secondary or manager. Never guess on P1 incidents.

**Q: Can I silence an alert that's noisy?**
A: Temporarily (< 1 hour) while investigating. But file a ticket to fix the root cause or adjust the threshold.

**Q: What if I need to cancel my on-call shift?**
A: Notify manager at least 48 hours in advance. Find someone to swap with if possible.

**Q: Should I deploy a fix during my shift?**
A: For hotfixes to resolve P1, yes (with manager approval). For non-urgent fixes, wait for business hours.

**Q: How do I handle alerts during a deployment?**
A: Consider silencing expected alerts. But watch dashboards closely and rollback if issues arise.
