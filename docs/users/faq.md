# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is Clipper?

Clipper is a community-driven platform for discovering, curating, and sharing the best Twitch clips. Think of it as a social hub where the best moments from Twitch streams are collected, voted on, and discussed by the community.

### How do clips get added to Clipper?

Clips can be added to Clipper in several ways:

1. **User Submissions**: Community members can submit Twitch clip URLs
2. **Automatic Curation**: Our system monitors popular clips from featured streamers
3. **Direct Integration**: Clips may be automatically imported based on popularity metrics
4. **Broadcaster Submissions**: Streamers can share their own clips

All submitted clips go through a review process to ensure they meet our quality standards and community guidelines.

### Is Clipper free to use?

  - Vote on clips
  - Post comments
  - Save favorites

## Using the Platform

### How does the voting system work?

**Voting Basics**:

### What is karma and how does it work?

**Karma Overview**:
Karma is a score that represents your positive contributions to the Clipper community.

**Earning Karma**:
