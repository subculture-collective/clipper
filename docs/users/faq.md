# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is Clipper?

Clipper is a community-driven platform for discovering, curating, and sharing the best Twitch clips. Think of it as a social hub where the best moments from Twitch streams are collected, voted on, and discussed by the community.

### How do clips get added to Clipper?

Clips can be added to Clipper in several ways:

1. **User Submissions**: Community members can submit Twitch clip URLs
2. **Automatic Curation**: Our system monitors popular clips from featured streamers
3. **Direct Integration**: Clips may be automatically imported based on popularity metrics
4. **Broadcaster Submissions**: Streamers can share their own clips

All submitted clips go through a review process to ensure they meet our quality standards and community guidelines.

### Is Clipper free to use?

Yes! Clipper is completely free to use. You can browse, watch, comment, vote, and save clips without any cost. There are no premium tiers or paywalls.

### Do I need a Twitch account to use Clipper?

- **Browsing**: No account needed to browse and watch clips
- **Interacting**: Yes, you need to sign in with Twitch to:
  - Vote on clips
  - Post comments
  - Save favorites
  - Submit clips
  - Earn karma

## Using the Platform

### How does the voting system work?

**Voting Basics**:

- Click the up arrow (↑) to upvote clips you enjoy
- Click the down arrow (↓) to downvote inappropriate or low-quality content
- Your vote affects the clip's score and visibility
- Higher-voted clips appear more prominently in feeds

**Vote Impact**:

- Votes determine clip rankings in "Hot" and "Top" feeds
- High-voted clips may reach the front page
- Vote patterns help our algorithm recommend similar content
- Content creators earn karma from upvotes

**Changing Your Vote**:

- Click the up arrow again to remove your upvote
- Click the down arrow again to remove your downvote
- You can switch between upvote and downvote at any time

### What is karma and how does it work?

**Karma Overview**:
Karma is a score that represents your positive contributions to the Clipper community.

**Earning Karma**:

- **+1**: Someone upvotes your clip submission
- **+1**: Someone upvotes your comment

**Losing Karma**:

- **-1**: Your submission gets downvoted
- **-1**: Your comment gets downvoted

**Karma Benefits**:

- Build community reputation and trust score
- Unlock features and badges at karma thresholds:
  - **10 karma**: Create tags
  - **50 karma**: Report content
  - **100 karma**: Submit clips
  - **500 karma**: Nominate featured clips
- Reach higher rank levels (Newcomer → Legend)
- Increase your trust score (karma is 40% of trust)

**Karma Ranks**:

| Karma Range | Rank |
|------------|------|
| 0-99 | Newcomer |
| 100-499 | Member |
| 500-999 | Regular |
| 1,000-4,999 | Contributor |
| 5,000-9,999 | Veteran |
| 10,000+ | Legend |

**Note**: Karma is primarily a measure of community contribution, not a competitive score. Focus on sharing quality content rather than maximizing karma.

### What is trust score and how does it work?

**Trust Score Overview**:
Your trust score (0-100) is a measure of your trustworthiness and positive contribution to the Clipper community. It's calculated from multiple factors and helps ensure quality content and interactions.

**How It's Calculated**:

Trust score combines four main components:

1. **Account Age (20%)**: Older accounts are more trusted
   - New account (0-30 days): 0-2 points
   - Established (31-180 days): 2-10 points  
   - Mature (180+ days): 10-20 points

2. **Karma (40%)**: Community validation of your contributions
   - 0 karma = 0 points
   - 2,500 karma = 10 points
   - 5,000 karma = 20 points
   - 10,000+ karma = 40 points (max)

3. **Activity (20%)**: Regular participation and engagement
   - Based on comments, votes, submissions, and days active
   - Consistent participation earns max 20 points

4. **Report Accuracy (20%)**: Quality of reports you file
   - Based on percentage of correct reports
   - 100% accuracy = 20 points
   - No reports filed = 0 points

**Trust Score Ranges**:

| Score | Level | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 90-100 | Exceptional | Highly trusted community leader |
| 75-89 | High | Very trusted contributor |
| 60-74 | Good | Trusted community member |
| 40-59 | Medium | Average user, building trust |
| 20-39 | Low | New or inactive user |
| 0-19 | Very Low | New account or flagged user |

**How Trust Scores Are Used**:

- **Content Filtering**: High-trust content may be auto-approved
- **Moderation**: High-trust reports are prioritized
- **Feature Access**: Some features require minimum trust scores
- **Spam Detection**: Low trust + rapid posting triggers filters

**How to Improve Your Trust Score**:

- **Earn karma** by submitting quality clips and helpful comments
- **Stay active** with regular participation (not just binge sessions)
- **File accurate reports** when you see guideline violations
- **Be patient** - account age improves automatically over time
- **Avoid violations** - bans cut your trust score in half

**Impact of Bans**:

- Temporary ban: Score halved during ban, restored when ban expires
- Permanent ban: Score halved indefinitely
- Example: 80 trust → 40 during ban → 80 after (temporary) or 40 forever (permanent)

**Where to Learn More**:
