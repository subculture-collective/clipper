# User Reputation System

This document describes the implementation of the user reputation system in Clipper, including karma, badges, ranks, and leaderboards.

## Overview

The reputation system is designed to encourage quality contributions and community engagement through a gamified experience similar to Reddit's karma system. Users earn reputation through positive interactions and unlock features at various karma thresholds.

## Database Schema

### Tables

#### `user_badges`

Stores badge assignments to users.

- `id` - Unique badge assignment ID
- `user_id` - User who owns the badge
- `badge_id` - Badge type identifier
- `awarded_at` - When the badge was awarded
- `awarded_by` - User who awarded the badge (NULL for automatic)

#### `karma_history`

Tracks all karma changes for auditing and analytics.

- `id` - Unique history entry ID
- `user_id` - User whose karma changed
- `amount` - Karma change amount (positive or negative)
- `source` - Source of karma change (e.g., 'clip_vote', 'comment_vote')
- `source_id` - ID of the related entity (clip ID, comment ID, etc.)
- `created_at` - When the karma change occurred

#### `user_stats`

Stores calculated user statistics and scores.

- `user_id` - User ID (primary key)
- `trust_score` - Trust score (0-100)
- `engagement_score` - Engagement score
- `total_comments` - Total comments posted
- `total_votes_cast` - Total votes cast
- `total_clips_submitted` - Total clips submitted
- `correct_reports` - Number of correct reports
- `incorrect_reports` - Number of incorrect reports
- `days_active` - Number of days user has been active
- `last_active_date` - Last date user was active
- `updated_at` - Last update timestamp

### Database Functions

#### `update_user_karma(user_id, amount, source, source_id)`

Updates a user's karma and creates a history entry atomically.

#### `calculate_trust_score(user_id)`

Calculates trust score (0-100) based on:

- Account age (max 20 points)
- Karma amount (max 40 points)
- Report accuracy (max 20 points)
- Activity level (max 20 points)
- Penalty for banned users (50% reduction)

#### `calculate_engagement_score(user_id)`

Calculates engagement score based on activity:

- Comments: 2 points each
- Votes: 1 point each
- Clip submissions: 5 points each
- Days active: 3 points each

#### `get_user_rank(karma)`

Returns rank name based on karma:

- 0-99: Newcomer
- 100-499: Member
- 500-999: Regular
- 1,000-4,999: Contributor
- 5,000-9,999: Veteran
- 10,000+: Legend

### Database Triggers

#### Automatic Karma Updates

Triggers automatically update karma when votes are added, changed, or removed:

- `trigger_award_karma_on_clip_vote` - Awards karma for clip votes
- `trigger_award_karma_on_comment_vote` - Awards karma for comment votes

## Badge System

### Badge Categories

- **Trusted User** (‚úÖ) - Earned 1,000+ karma
- **Conversationalist** (üí¨) - Posted 100+ comments
- **Curator** (üëç) - Cast 1,000+ votes
- **Submitter** (üìπ) - Submitted 50+ clips

#### Staff Badges

Manually awarded by admins:

- **Moderator** (üõ°Ô∏è) - Community moderator
- **Admin** (üëë) - Site administrator
- **Developer** (üíª) - Platform developer

#### Supporter Badges

- **Supporter** (‚ù§Ô∏è) - Financial supporter

### Badge Awarding

Badges can be awarded in two ways:

1. **Automatic** - System automatically checks and awards achievement badges when criteria are met
2. **Manual** - Admins can award any badge to any user via the admin API

## Karma System

### Karma Sources

Users earn karma from:

- **Clip votes** - +1 for upvote, -1 for downvote (on their submitted clips)
- **Comment votes** - +1 for upvote, -1 for downvote (on their comments)

### Karma Permissions

Certain actions require minimum karma:

- **10 karma** - Create tags
- **50 karma** - Report content
- **100 karma** - Submit clips
- **500 karma** - Nominate featured clips

These thresholds are checked using the `CanUserPerformAction()` function in the reputation service.

## Rank System

Users are automatically assigned ranks based on their total karma:

| Karma Range | Rank | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 0-99 | Newcomer | New to the community |
| 100-499 | Member | Regular member |
| 500-999 | Regular | Active contributor |
| 1,000-4,999 | Contributor | Valued contributor |
| 5,000-9,999 | Veteran | Long-time contributor |
| 10,000+ | Legend | Top contributor |

Ranks are calculated dynamically using the `get_user_rank()` database function.

## Trust Score

Trust score (0-100) is calculated based on multiple factors:

- Account age (older accounts score higher)
- Karma amount (more karma = higher score)
- Report accuracy (correct reports boost score)
- Activity level (comments, votes, submissions)
- Moderation history (bans reduce score)

Trust score can be used for:

- Content filtering (hiding low-trust spam)
- Moderation weight (high-trust users' reports valued more)
- Feature unlocking

## Engagement Score

Engagement score measures user activity:

- Comments posted (2 points each)
- Votes cast (1 point each)
- Clips submitted (5 points each)
- Days active (3 points each)

Higher engagement scores indicate more active community members.

## Usage Examples

### Check if User Can Perform Action

```go
canCreateTags := services.CanUserPerformAction(user.KarmaPoints, "create_tags")
if !canCreateTags {
    return errors.New("insufficient karma to create tags")
}
```

### Award Badge Manually

```go
err := reputationService.AwardBadge(ctx, userID, "beta_tester", &adminID)
```

### Check and Award Automatic Badges

```go
awardedBadges, err := reputationService.CheckAndAwardBadges(ctx, userID)
// Returns list of newly awarded badge IDs
```

### Update User Activity

```go
// When user posts a comment
err := reputationService.IncrementUserActivity(ctx, userID, "comment", 1)

// When user casts a vote
err := reputationService.IncrementUserActivity(ctx, userID, "vote", 1)

// When user submits a clip
err := reputationService.IncrementUserActivity(ctx, userID, "submission", 1)
```

## Testing

The reputation system includes comprehensive unit tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./internal/services/reputation_service_test.go

# Test coverage includes:
# - Rank calculation
# - Badge validation
# - Permission checks
# - Badge definitions
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:

- Weighted karma (recent activity weighted higher)
- Time decay (older karma worth less)
- Quality bonuses for top comments
- Vote weight for high-karma users
- Monthly MVP recognition
- Activity heatmaps
- Karma trends over time
- Notification system for milestones
- Profile customization (badge ordering, visibility settings)
