# GDPR Data Subject Request System

## Overview

## Implemented Features

## Not Implemented (Deferred)

The following features from the comprehensive GDPR issue are **not implemented** but are not strictly required for basic GDPR compliance:

### 1. Unified Data Subject Request System

- **Status:** Not implemented
- **Rationale:** Current implementation provides all required GDPR rights through individual endpoints. A unified tracking system is an enterprise feature useful for organizations with high request volumes but not legally required.
- **Alternative:** Current system with separate endpoints and audit logging meets compliance.

### 2. Admin Panel for GDPR Requests

- **Status:** Not implemented
- **Rationale:** Most requests (export, rectification) are fully automated. Deletion requests have a 30-day grace period which provides sufficient time for manual review if needed.
- **Alternative:** Audit logs can be queried directly for compliance review.

### 3. Right to Restriction of Processing (Article 18)

- **Status:** Not implemented as automated feature
- **Rationale:** This right applies to specific circumstances (accuracy disputes, legal claims, etc.) and is rarely exercised. GDPR allows handling via support tickets.
- **Alternative:** Users can contact <privacy@clipper.gg> for restriction requests, which can be handled manually.

### 4. Right to Object to Processing (Article 21)

- **Status:** Partially implemented (cookie consent covers marketing/analytics)
- **Rationale:** Cookie consent system allows users to object to marketing and analytics processing. Other objections are rare and can be handled via support.
- **Alternative:** Cookie Settings + <privacy@clipper.gg> for specific objection requests.

### 5. Email Notifications for Request Lifecycle

- **Status:** Not implemented
- **Rationale:** Export is immediate (no waiting), deletion has 30-day grace period with status check available.
- **Alternative:** In-app status indicators and user-initiated status checks.

### 6. Two-Step Email Verification for Deletion

- **Status:** Not implemented
- **Rationale:** User must be logged in (session authenticated) and type exact confirmation text. Additional email step would add friction without significant security benefit for logged-in users.
- **Alternative:** Current confirmation requirement + 30-day cancellation period.

### 7. Advanced Identity Verification (SMS)

- **Status:** Not implemented
- **Rationale:** Session authentication + explicit confirmation text provides adequate verification for standard accounts.
- **Alternative:** Manual verification available for high-risk accounts via support.

### 8. Rate Limiting (3 requests/24 hours)

- **Status:** Basic rate limiting exists (1 request/hour for exports)
- **Rationale:** Current rate limiting prevents abuse. Lower limit would improve DoS protection but is not legally required.
- **Alternative:** Monitoring and manual intervention for suspicious activity.
