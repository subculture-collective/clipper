# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting significant architectural decisions made for the Clipper project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

- **Title**: Short descriptive title
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: The situation prompting the decision
- **Decision**: The architectural decision made
- **Consequences**: Results and trade-offs of the decision
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated

## Index of ADRs

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [ADR-001](./001-semantic-search-vector-db.md) | Semantic Search Vector Database Selection | Accepted | 2025-11-03 |

2. Number it sequentially (e.g., ADR-002)
3. Fill in all sections with relevant information
4. Update this README with the new ADR
5. Commit and submit for review
