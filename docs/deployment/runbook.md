# Operations Runbook

> **Note**: The comprehensive operations runbook is maintained at [[../operations/runbook|operations/runbook.md]]. This page provides quick deployment-specific procedures.

For complete operational procedures including monitoring, incident response, deployment testing, and rollback drills, see [[../operations/runbook|Operations Runbook]].

## Quick Deployment Procedures

### Deploy New Version

```bash
# Deploy new version
kubectl set image deployment/backend backend=clipper:v1.2.3 -n clipper

# Check rollout status
kubectl rollout status deployment/backend -n clipper

# Rollback if needed
kubectl rollout undo deployment/backend -n clipper
```

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

1. **Run Deployment Tests**: Verify all deployment scripts pass tests
   ```bash
   cd scripts && ./test-deployment-harness.sh
   ```

2. **Run Rollback Drill**: Validate rollback procedures
   ```bash
   DRY_RUN=true ./rollback-drill.sh
   ```

3. **Review Artifacts**: Check logs and reports for warnings

4. **Staging Rehearsal**: Full end-to-end test
   ```bash
   ./staging-rehearsal.sh
   ```

### Post-Deployment Verification

1. Check service health: `kubectl get pods -n clipper`
2. Check logs: `kubectl logs -f deployment/backend -n clipper`
3. Verify metrics in Grafana
4. Run smoke tests
5. Monitor for 30 minutes

## Common Deployment Issues

### Deployment Stuck

1. Check pod events: `kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n clipper`
2. Check resource limits and quotas
3. Verify image pull credentials
4. Check for failing health checks

### Rolling Update Failed

1. Check rollout status: `kubectl rollout status deployment/backend -n clipper`
2. Review pod logs for errors
3. Rollback: `kubectl rollout undo deployment/backend -n clipper`
4. Investigate and fix issues before re-deploying
