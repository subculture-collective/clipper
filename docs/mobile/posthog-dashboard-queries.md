Time Range: Last 12 months
Interval: Monthly (rolling 30-day window)
```

#### Stickiness Ratio
```
Formula: (DAU / MAU) * 100
Where:
  DAU = Count distinct users (daily)
  MAU = Count distinct users (30-day rolling)
Filters: platform = mobile
Display: Percentage
```

## Property Filters

### Common Filters

```
Platform Filter:
  platform = mobile

Authenticated Users:
  is_authenticated = true

iOS Only:
  platform = mobile AND device_os = iOS

Android Only:
  platform = mobile AND device_os = Android

Specific App Version:
  platform = mobile AND app_version = 1.2.0

Recent Users (Last 7 Days):
  platform = mobile AND last_seen >= now() - interval '7 days'
```

### Advanced Filters

```
Power Users (High Activity):
  platform = mobile AND 
  event_count_last_7d >= 50

Content Creators:
  platform = mobile AND 
  submission_create_completed_count > 0

Engaged Users (Comments/Votes):
  platform = mobile AND 
  (comment_create_completed_count > 0 OR upvote_clicked_count > 0)

Users with Errors:
  platform = mobile AND 
  error_occurred_count > 0

Session Duration Filter:
  platform = mobile AND 
  session_duration_seconds >= 60
```

## Breakdown Dimensions

## Tips & Best Practices

### Query Optimization

1. **Use Time Ranges Wisely**: Shorter ranges = faster queries
2. **Limit Breakdowns**: Too many breakdowns slow down queries
3. **Use Sampling**: For large datasets, enable sampling (10% sample for exploratory analysis)
4. **Cache Results**: PostHog caches insight results; use cached results when possible
5. **Aggregate When Possible**: Use daily aggregation instead of hourly for long time ranges

### Data Quality

1. **Filter Test Users**: Exclude test/internal users with email filter
2. **Remove Duplicates**: Use distinct user/session counts appropriately
3. **Handle Null Values**: Filter out null properties when calculating averages
4. **Timezone Consistency**: Use UTC or user's local timezone consistently
5. **Version Filtering**: Compare same app versions or filter recent versions only

### Dashboard Performance

1. **Limit Insights Per Dashboard**: Max 10-15 insights for good performance
2. **Use Summary Stats**: Add stat cards for quick overview
3. **Progressive Loading**: Place most important insights at the top
4. **Set Refresh Rates**: Balance freshness with performance (5-15 min refresh)
5. **Archive Old Dashboards**: Keep dashboard list manageable
