## Validation Checklist

Before considering setup complete, verify:

### Data Quality
- [ ] All insights showing data (not empty)
- [ ] Event counts seem reasonable
- [ ] No unusual spikes or drops (unless expected)
- [ ] Breakdown dimensions working correctly
- [ ] Filters applied properly

### Dashboard Functionality
- [ ] All insights load within 5 seconds
- [ ] Refresh works correctly
- [ ] Time range selectors work
- [ ] Breakdowns display properly
- [ ] Mobile view is readable

### Team Access
- [ ] All team members can access dashboards
- [ ] Permissions set correctly (view vs edit)
- [ ] Dashboard links work
- [ ] Alerts configured and tested

### Integration
- [ ] Sentry links work (if applicable)
- [ ] Slack notifications working
- [ ] Email reports being received

---

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Showing

**Check**:
1. PostHog SDK initialized correctly in mobile app
2. Events being sent (check PostHog Live Events)
3. Filters not too restrictive (try removing `platform = mobile` temporarily)
4. Time range includes data
5. User granted analytics consent

**Solution**:
- Review [POSTHOG_ANALYTICS.md](../../mobile/POSTHOG_ANALYTICS.md) integration guide
- Check mobile app logs for analytics errors
- Verify PostHog API key configured

### Slow Dashboard Loading

**Optimize**:
1. Reduce time range (90 days → 30 days)
2. Limit breakdowns (top 10 instead of all)
3. Use sampling for exploratory analysis
4. Simplify complex formulas
5. Cache results when possible

### Incorrect Metrics

**Verify**:
1. Event names match exactly (case-sensitive)
2. Property names correct
3. Aggregation function appropriate
4. Filters working as expected
5. No duplicate event sends

**Debug**:
- Check event examples in PostHog
- Compare with raw event data
- Verify calculation formulas
- Review recent SDK changes

## Next Steps

After setup is complete:

1. **Week 1**: Monitor daily, familiarize team with dashboards
2. **Week 2**: Establish baseline metrics, set targets
3. **Week 3**: Identify optimization opportunities
4. **Week 4**: Review and iterate on dashboards
5. **Monthly**: Review retention, adjust as needed

**Estimated Total Time**: 4.5 hours + 1 hour for post-setup = **5.5 hours**

**Success Criteria**: All 5 dashboards created, data flowing, team has access, alerts configured.
