# Mobile Analytics Dashboards

This document provides comprehensive setup instructions for PostHog dashboards to visualize mobile app metrics for the Clipper mobile application.

## Overview

The mobile analytics dashboards provide insights into user behavior, engagement, retention, and app stability. These dashboards are built on top of the PostHog SDK integration documented in [mobile/POSTHOG_ANALYTICS.md](../../mobile/POSTHOG_ANALYTICS.md).

## Dashboard Suite

We maintain five core dashboards for mobile analytics:

1. **Mobile User Funnels** - User journey conversion analysis
2. **Mobile Retention Analysis** - Cohort retention tracking
3. **Mobile Screen Views** - Navigation patterns and screen engagement
4. **Mobile Stability** - Crash-free sessions and error tracking
5. **Mobile DAU/MAU** - Daily and monthly active user metrics

## Prerequisites

- PostHog project configured with API key
- Mobile app deployed with PostHog SDK integration
- Access to PostHog dashboard (app.posthog.com or self-hosted instance)
- Admin or team member access to create dashboards

## Event Schema Reference

All dashboards use the standardized mobile event schema defined in `mobile/lib/analytics.ts`:

### Core Event Categories

- **AuthEvents**: `signup_started`, `signup_completed`, `login_completed`, `logout`, `oauth_callback`
- **SubmissionEvents**: `submission_viewed`, `submission_create_started`, `submission_create_completed`, `submission_play_started`
- **EngagementEvents**: `upvote_clicked`, `downvote_clicked`, `comment_create_completed`, `follow_clicked`, `search_performed`
- **NavigationEvents**: `screen_viewed`, `page_viewed`, `tab_clicked`
- **ErrorEvents**: `error_occurred`, `api_error`, `network_error`, `video_playback_error`
- **PerformanceEvents**: `page_load_time`, `api_response_time`, `video_load_time`

### Common Event Properties

- `user_id`: Unique user identifier
- `screen_name`: Current screen name
- `timestamp`: Event timestamp (ISO 8601)
- `app_version`: Mobile app version
- `device_os`: Operating system (iOS/Android)
- `device_model`: Device model name
- `platform`: Always "mobile" for mobile events

## Dashboard Setup Instructions

### Dashboard 1: Mobile User Funnels

Step 3: login_completed
Step 4: submission_viewed (first clip view)
```

**Filters**:
- Time range: Last 30 days
- Platform: `platform = mobile`
- Breakdown by: `device_os` (iOS vs Android)

**Insight Configuration**:
- Conversion window: 24 hours
- Visualization: Funnel chart
- Show conversion rate percentages

#### Funnel B: Content Engagement Journey
```
Step 1: submission_viewed

## Dashboard Organization

### Recommended Layout

```
PostHog Projects
└── Clipper Mobile
    └── Dashboards
        ├── 📊 Mobile User Funnels
        ├── 📈 Mobile Retention Analysis
        ├── 🧭 Mobile Screen Views
        ├── 🛡️ Mobile Stability
        └── 👥 Mobile DAU/MAU
```

### Dashboard Naming Convention

- Prefix all mobile dashboards with "Mobile" for easy filtering
- Use emojis for visual identification (optional)
- Keep names concise but descriptive
- Tag all dashboards with: `mobile`, `analytics`, `production`

### Access Control

**Recommended Access Levels**:
- **View**: All team members
- **Edit**: Product managers, analytics team, engineering leads
- **Admin**: Product owner, analytics lead

### Sharing

1. Generate shareable links for stakeholder reviews
2. Set up Slack notifications for key metric changes
3. Schedule weekly dashboard email digests
4. Embed dashboards in internal tools (e.g., Notion, Confluence)

---

## Data Validation & Testing

### Testing with Staging Environment

Before relying on production data, validate dashboards in staging:

1. **Generate Test Events**:
   ```bash
   # Use mobile app in staging with PostHog configured
   # Perform typical user flows:
   - Sign up new account
   - Browse feed
   - Play clips
   - Submit content
   - Navigate between screens
   - Trigger intentional errors
   ```

2. **Verify Event Capture**:
   - Navigate to PostHog → Live Events
   - Filter by `platform = mobile`
   - Confirm events appear with correct properties
   - Check for missing or malformed data

3. **Cross-Check Counts**:
   - Compare event counts with app usage logs
   - Verify user counts match authentication logs
   - Check session counts align with app analytics
   - Validate timestamp accuracy

4. **Dashboard Refresh**:
   - Refresh dashboards after test events
   - Verify new data appears correctly
   - Check filters are working
   - Confirm breakdowns display properly

### Data Freshness Validation

- PostHog typically has <5 minute data delay
- Check "Last updated" timestamp on insights
- If data seems stale, check PostHog ingestion status
- Verify mobile app is sending events (check PostHog debugger)

### Common Data Quality Issues

**Missing Events**:
- Symptom: Events not appearing in PostHog
- Causes: Network issues, consent not granted, SDK initialization failed
- Solution: Check app logs, verify API key, test in PostHog debugger

**Incorrect Event Properties**:
- Symptom: Properties null or wrong type
- Causes: Code bug, schema mismatch, version differences
- Solution: Review analytics.ts, check event tracking calls

**Duplicate Events**:
- Symptom: Inflated event counts
- Causes: Double initialization, retry logic, dev/staging mixed
- Solution: Add distinct ID checks, separate environments

**Session Misattribution**:
- Symptom: Sessions incorrectly counted
- Causes: Session timeout issues, app backgrounding
- Solution: Review session management, adjust timeout

---

## Integration with Other Tools

### Sentry Integration

Correlate PostHog events with Sentry errors:

1. Add `sentry_event_id` to error tracking events
2. Link from PostHog dashboard to Sentry issues
3. Create combined view for stability monitoring

**Code Example**:
```typescript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';
import { trackError } from '@/lib/analytics';

try {
  // Some code that might fail
} catch (error) {
  const sentryEventId = Sentry.captureException(error);
  trackError(error as Error, {
    errorType: 'UnexpectedError',
    sentry_event_id: sentryEventId,
  });
}
```

### Grafana Integration

For unified monitoring:
- Create Grafana dashboard that pulls PostHog metrics via API
- Display mobile metrics alongside backend metrics
- Correlate mobile errors with API performance

### Slack Integration

Set up Slack notifications:
- Daily digest of key metrics
- Alert notifications for critical thresholds
- Weekly dashboard screenshot shares

---

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Not Showing Data

**Check**:
1. ✅ PostHog API key configured correctly in mobile app
2. ✅ User has granted analytics consent
3. ✅ Events are being sent (check PostHog Live Events)
4. ✅ Time range includes data
5. ✅ Filters not overly restrictive

### Metrics Seem Wrong

**Verify**:
1. Event schema matches expectations (check event examples)
2. Property names and types are correct
3. No duplicate event sends
4. Correct calculation formulas
5. Timezone settings

### Dashboard Performance Issues

**Optimize**:
1. Reduce time range for complex queries
2. Use sampling for large datasets
3. Cache frequently accessed insights
4. Simplify breakdowns
5. Use PostHog recording rules for pre-aggregation

### Missing Events

**Debug**:
1. Check PostHog debugger in mobile app (enable in dev mode)
2. Review app logs for analytics errors
3. Verify network connectivity
4. Check PostHog service status
5. Review recent SDK version changes
