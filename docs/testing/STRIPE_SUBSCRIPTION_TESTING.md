## Stripe Dashboard Reconciliation

### Daily Reconciliation Checklist

1. **Revenue Verification**
   ```
   - Compare Stripe revenue reports with database
   - Check subscription_events table
   - Verify payment intent amounts
   - Reconcile refunds and disputes
   ```

2. **Subscription Status Sync**
   ```sql
   -- Query to check status mismatches
   SELECT s.id, s.user_id, s.status, s.stripe_subscription_id, s.updated_at
   FROM subscriptions s
   WHERE s.status IN ('active', 'past_due', 'trialing')
   ORDER BY s.updated_at DESC;
   ```
   - Cross-reference with Stripe Dashboard
   - Investigate any mismatches
   - Check for missed webhooks

3. **Failed Webhook Investigation**
   ```sql
   -- Check webhook retry queue
   SELECT * FROM webhook_retry_queue 
   WHERE status = 'failed' 
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```
   - Review failed webhook events
   - Manually replay if necessary
   - Fix root cause (endpoint down, invalid data, etc.)

4. **Dunning Status Review**
   ```sql
   -- Check active dunning attempts
   SELECT d.*, s.user_id, s.status 
   FROM dunning_attempts d
   JOIN subscriptions s ON d.subscription_id = s.id
   WHERE d.status = 'active'
   ORDER BY d.next_retry_at;
   ```
   - Review pending payment retries
   - Check grace period expirations
   - Verify email notifications sent

5. **Monthly Metrics Reconciliation**
   - MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
   - ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)
   - Churn rate
   - Payment success rate
   - Average subscription value
   - Customer lifetime value

### Automated Reconciliation Script

```bash
# Run daily reconciliation report
cd backend
go run cmd/backfill-stripe-metrics/main.go --date=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
```

## Edge Cases and Known Issues

### Edge Case 1: Trial Period Subscriptions

**Scenario**: User subscribes with trial period

**Behavior**:
- Subscription status: "trialing"
- No immediate charge
- Invoice generated at trial end
- Webhook `customer.subscription.trial_will_end` sent 3 days before

**Test Steps**:
1. Create checkout session with trial period
2. Verify trial status set correctly
3. Wait for trial to end (or simulate time)
4. Verify conversion to active subscription

### Edge Case 2: Timezone Handling

**Issue**: Period start/end times may differ between Stripe (UTC) and local timezone

**Solution**:
- Store all dates in UTC in database
- Convert to user timezone for display
- Use Unix timestamps from Stripe webhooks

**Verification**:
```sql
SELECT 
    current_period_start,
    current_period_end,
    EXTRACT(TIMEZONE FROM current_period_start) as start_tz,
    EXTRACT(TIMEZONE FROM current_period_end) as end_tz
FROM subscriptions;
```

### Edge Case 3: Concurrent Subscription Updates

**Scenario**: User initiates two subscription changes simultaneously

**Behavior**:
- Idempotency keys prevent duplicate charges
- Later webhook overrides earlier one
- Race condition possible

**Mitigation**:
- Use database transactions
- Implement optimistic locking
- Check event timestamps

### Edge Case 4: Webhook Delivery Failures

**Scenario**: Webhook endpoint unavailable or returns error

**Behavior**:
- Stripe retries with exponential backoff
- Up to 3 days of retries
- Events may arrive out of order

**Mitigation**:
- Implement webhook retry queue
- Log all webhook events
- Use event IDs for idempotency
- Manual replay capability

**Recovery Process**:
```sql
-- Find missing events
SELECT stripe_event_id FROM subscription_events 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';

-- Compare with Stripe Dashboard events
-- Manually replay missing events via API
```

### Edge Case 5: Payment Method Expiration

**Scenario**: Card expires before next billing date

**Behavior**:
- Stripe sends `customer.source.expiring` webhook ~30 days before
- Email notification sent to user
- Payment may fail if not updated

**Test Steps**:
1. Set card expiration to current month + 1
2. Verify expiration notification sent
3. Test payment failure handling
4. Verify grace period applied

### Edge Case 6: Duplicate Customer Accounts

**Scenario**: User creates multiple accounts with same email

**Behavior**:
- Multiple Stripe customers created
- Potential for duplicate subscriptions

**Mitigation**:
- Check for existing customer by email
- Merge customers if necessary
- Implement email uniqueness constraint

### Edge Case 7: Refund Requests

**Scenario**: User requests refund mid-cycle

**Process**:
1. Review refund policy (e.g., 30-day guarantee)
2. Issue refund via Stripe Dashboard
3. Cancel subscription
4. Downgrade user to free tier
5. Log refund in audit trail

**Expected Behavior**:
- Webhook `charge.refunded` received
- Full or partial refund processed
- Subscription canceled or adjusted
- User notified

### Edge Case 8: Tax Calculation Errors

**Scenario**: Stripe Tax enabled but fails to calculate

**Behavior**:
- Checkout may fail
- Invoice amount incorrect

**Mitigation**:
- Fallback to manual tax calculation
- Verify billing address completeness
- Test with various locales

**Test Steps**:
1. Enable Stripe Tax in settings
2. Test checkout with various countries
3. Verify tax rates applied correctly
4. Check invoice line items

### Edge Case 9: Zero-Dollar Invoices

**Scenario**: 100% discount coupon or credit balance covers invoice

**Behavior**:
- Invoice marked as paid
- No payment intent created
- Subscription remains active

**Verification**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM subscription_events 
WHERE event_type = 'invoice_paid' 
AND data->>'amount_paid' = '0';
```

### Edge Case 10: Subscription in Incomplete State

**Scenario**: Payment requires additional authentication but not completed

**Behavior**:
- Subscription status: "incomplete"
- Payment intent status: "requires_action"
- User must complete authentication

**Resolution**:
- Send reminder email with payment link
- After 23 hours, subscription canceled if not completed
- Webhook `customer.subscription.updated` sent
