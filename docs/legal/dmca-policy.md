## Counter-Notice Response Process

Upon receiving a valid DMCA counter-notice, we will:

### 1. Initial Review (Within 24 Hours)

- Verify the counter-notice contains all required elements per 17 U.S.C. § 512(g)(3)
- Confirm identity of the user who submitted the counter-notice

### 2. Forward to Original Complainant (Within 2-3 Business Days)

- Send a copy of the counter-notice to the original copyright holder
- Inform them they have 10-14 business days to file a lawsuit seeking a court order to restrain the allegedly infringing activity

### 3. Reinstatement (After 10-14 Business Days)

If the original complainant does not notify us that they have filed a lawsuit:

- **Restore the removed content** to the Service
- Notify the user that their content has been reinstated
- Remove the strike from the user's account (if applicable)

If the original complainant notifies us of a lawsuit:

- **Keep the content removed** pending court resolution
- Notify the user of the lawsuit
- Maintain the strike on the user's account

### Important Notes

- **We do not make legal judgments** about the merits of counter-notices.
- **The decision to reinstate is statutory** under the DMCA (10-14 business days).
- **Filing a counter-notice exposes you to potential litigation** – the original complainant may sue you.
- **Consult an attorney** before filing a counter-notice if you're unsure about your rights.

## Repeat Infringer Policy

Clipper has adopted and implements a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances, users who are repeat infringers of copyright.

### Three-Strike System

**Strike 1 - First Offense:**
- Content removed immediately upon valid DMCA notice
- **Warning** sent to user via email
- Educational information about copyright provided
- Account remains active with full access
- Strike recorded in user's account history

**Strike 2 - Second Offense:**
- Content removed immediately upon valid DMCA notice
- **Temporary suspension** of account for 7 days
- User cannot submit new content, comment, or vote during suspension
- User can view content and access their profile
- Final warning issued
- Strike recorded in user's account history

**Strike 3 - Third Offense:**
- Content removed immediately upon valid DMCA notice
- **Permanent account termination**
- All user content may be removed or anonymized
- User banned from creating new accounts
- No refunds for Premium subscriptions
- IP address may be flagged to prevent circumvention

### Strike Expiration

- Strikes expire after **12 months** from the date of the infringement notice
- If a user receives no new strikes for 12 consecutive months, their oldest strike is automatically removed
- Users can rebuild their standing over time with compliant behavior

### Appeal Process

Users may appeal strikes by:

1. **Submitting a written appeal** to <dmca@clpr.tv> with subject "DMCA Strike Appeal"
2. **Providing evidence** that:
   - The DMCA notice was invalid or incomplete
   - They have obtained permission or a license from the copyright holder
   - The content qualifies as fair use
   - The content was misidentified
3. **Waiting for review** – appeals are reviewed within 5-7 business days
4. **Receiving a decision** – decisions are final unless new evidence is presented

### Considerations for Termination

We may consider the following factors when deciding whether to terminate an account:

- Number and frequency of infringement notices
- Severity of infringement (commercial vs. personal use)
- User's response to notices (cooperation vs. resistance)
- Whether the user filed counter-notices (good faith engagement)
- User's overall contribution to the community
- Evidence of willful or repeat infringement

### Record-Keeping

We maintain records of:

- All DMCA notices received
- All strikes issued to user accounts
- All appeals and their outcomes
- All account terminations related to copyright infringement
- Records retained for at least 3 years

## False Claims and Misrepresentation

### 17 U.S.C. § 512(f) - Liability for Misrepresentation

**Warning:** Making false claims in a DMCA notice or counter-notice can result in serious legal consequences.

Under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f):

> "Any person who knowingly materially misrepresents under this section (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, shall be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner's authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of the service provider relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it."

### Consequences of False DMCA Claims

If you submit a false or bad faith DMCA notice or counter-notice, you may face:

1. **Legal Liability:**
   - Damages (actual and statutory)
   - Costs and attorneys' fees
   - Potential criminal charges for perjury (false statements under penalty of perjury)

2. **Account Actions:**
   - Account suspension or termination
   - Ban from using Clipper services
   - Removal of ability to submit DMCA notices

3. **Legal Action by Clipper:**
   - We may pursue legal action against repeat abusers
   - We may report fraudulent notices to law enforcement

### Examples of Bad Faith Notices

- **Claiming copyright you don't own** to remove competitor content
- **False DMCA notices** to harass or silence other users
- **Abusing the counter-notice process** when you know content is infringing
- **Submitting notices for non-copyright reasons** (e.g., defamation, privacy)
- **Mass-automated notices** without individual review

### Good Faith Requirement

Before submitting a DMCA notice, you should:

- **Verify you own the copyright** or are authorized to act on behalf of the owner
- **Confirm the use is not authorized** (check for licenses, fair use)
- **Review the content carefully** to ensure accurate identification
- **Consider fair use defenses** (commentary, criticism, parody, news reporting, education, research)
- **Consult an attorney** if you're unsure about your rights

---

## No Obligation to Monitor

**Important:** Clipper is not obligated to monitor user-submitted content for copyright infringement.

Under 17 U.S.C. § 512(m):

- We do not actively monitor the Service for infringing content
- We do not affirmatively seek facts indicating infringing activity
- We are not required to police our users or remove content proactively

**However:**

- We respond promptly to valid DMCA notices
- We investigate reports from copyright holders
- We cooperate with law enforcement and legal authorities
- We may remove obviously infringing content at our discretion

**Copyright holders are responsible for:**

- Monitoring the internet for unauthorized use of their works
- Identifying specific infringing material
- Submitting valid DMCA notices for each instance of infringement

---

## Fair Use and User Rights

### What is Fair Use?

"Fair use" is a legal doctrine (17 U.S.C. § 107) that permits limited use of copyrighted material without permission for purposes such as:

- Commentary and criticism
- News reporting
- Teaching and education
- Scholarship and research
- Parody and transformative works

### Fair Use Factors

Courts consider four factors when determining fair use:

1. **Purpose and character of use** (commercial vs. non-profit educational; transformative nature)
2. **Nature of the copyrighted work** (factual vs. creative)
3. **Amount and substantiality** used in relation to the whole work
4. **Effect on the market** for the original work

### Fair Use is Not a Safe Harbor

**Important:** Fair use is a legal defense, not a safe harbor. Clipper cannot make legal determinations about fair use. If you receive a DMCA notice and believe your use is fair use, you should:

1. **Consult an attorney** for legal advice
2. **File a counter-notice** explaining why your use is fair use
3. **Be prepared to defend** your position in court if necessary

**We encourage users to:**

- Obtain permission or licenses when possible
- Use only what is necessary for your purpose
- Transform or add original commentary to borrowed material
- Credit original creators and sources
- Understand your rights and limitations under copyright law

---

## Twitch Content and Third-Party Rights

### Clipper is a Twitch Clip Aggregator

Clipper hosts user-submitted links to Twitch clips. Important considerations:

1. **Twitch Clips:**
   - Clips are hosted by Twitch, not Clipper
   - Twitch has its own DMCA process and copyright policies
   - Users must comply with Twitch's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines

2. **User Submissions:**
   - Users submit clip URLs, metadata (title, description), and tags
   - Users represent they have rights to submit the clip
   - Users grant Clipper a license to display and distribute submissions (per Terms of Service)

3. **Third-Party Content:**
   - Clips may contain copyrighted music, video, images, or other content
   - Streamers may have licenses (e.g., Soundtrack by Twitch) but users may not
   - Clipper relies on Twitch's copyright filtering and detection

### DMCA Notices for Twitch Clips

If you believe a Twitch clip on Clipper infringes your copyright:

**Option 1: Submit a notice to Clipper** (<dmca@clpr.tv>)
- We will remove the clip from Clipper's platform
- The clip will remain on Twitch unless you also notify Twitch

**Option 2: Submit a notice to Twitch** (<https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/dmca-guidelines/>)
- Twitch may remove the clip from their platform
- If Twitch removes the clip, it will no longer be accessible on Clipper

**Best Practice:** Submit notices to both Clipper and Twitch for complete removal.
