We are not responsible for Twitch content or any interruption in Twitch's services.

**Important Twitch Compliance Disclosures:**

- **Content Ownership:** All Twitch clips, streams, and other content displayed on Clipper remain the property of their respective creators and Twitch. Clipper does not claim ownership of any Twitch content.

- **Embed-Only Playback:** All Twitch videos and clips are displayed using official Twitch embed players. We do NOT download, re-host, proxy, or redistribute Twitch video files.

- **Official APIs Only:** We access Twitch data exclusively through official Twitch Helix API endpoints. We do not scrape, parse, or use unofficial methods to access Twitch data.

- **Creator Rights:** Creators retain all rights to their content. If a clip is deleted by its creator or removed from Twitch, it will no longer be available on Clipper.

- **DMCA Compliance:** We comply with all DMCA takedown requests. If Twitch removes content due to copyright claims, that content will automatically become unavailable on Clipper.

- **OAuth Authorization:** When you connect your Twitch account to Clipper, you explicitly authorize us to access only the scopes you approve (e.g., chat:read, chat:edit). You can revoke this authorization at any time.

- **Data Usage:** We use Twitch data only for providing Service functionality (clip discovery, stream viewing, chat integration). We do NOT sell, license, or redistribute Twitch data to third parties.

For complete details on our Twitch compliance practices, see our [Twitch Compliance Documentation](/docs/compliance/).

### 15.3 Waiver

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of that right or provision. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Clipper.
