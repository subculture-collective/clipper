## Important Notes

### Renewal and Updates

### Multiple Service Providers

- List all service names in the "Alternate Names" field
- Or register each service separately ($6 per service)

### Compliance Timeline

**CRITICAL:** Registration must be completed BEFORE launch to claim safe harbor protection. Without registration:
- Clipper is not protected by DMCA safe harbor
- Company may be liable for user-uploaded copyrighted content
- Legal risk is significantly higher
