## Historical Context: Original Plan (Superseded)

The original plan outlined 25 feature category issues to be created individually. This approach was superseded by creating a comprehensive Roadmap 5.0 structure with 59 well-scoped issues organized by phase and epic, providing better:

- **Granularity**: Breaking down broad categories into actionable tasks
- **Organization**: Clear phase-based execution order with dependencies
- **Traceability**: Each issue maps back to specific feature inventory gaps
- **Scalability**: Issues can be assigned independently and tracked in parallel

All gaps from the original 25 categories are covered in the Roadmap 5.0 issues.

*This document serves as a historical record of the feature audit issue creation initiative. All issues have been created and are tracked in [#805 Roadmap 5.0 Master Tracker](https://github.com/subculture-collective/clipper/issues/805).*

**Sweep II Update (2026-01-14)**: Feature inventory verified and updated with 3 new implementations. All new features are infrastructure supporting existing Roadmap 5.0 issues. No additional audit issues required.
