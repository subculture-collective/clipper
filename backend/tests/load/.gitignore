# Baseline temporary files
# NOTE: "baselines/current" is a symlink created by capture_baseline.sh and is
# used for baseline comparisons. Symlinks can be problematic on some platforms
# (especially Windows), so this path is ignored in git and treated as a
# local-only helper. On platforms where symlinks are unreliable, compare
# directly against the concrete baseline directories under "baselines/"
# instead of relying on this symlink.
