# Security Summary - Clip Management API

## Security Analysis Date
**Date:** 2024-06-10
**Commit:** 346d70b

## CodeQL Security Scan Results
✅ **Status:** PASSED - 0 vulnerabilities found

## Security Measures Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
✅ **JWT-based authentication**
- Token validation on all protected endpoints
- Optional authentication for public endpoints
- User context properly extracted and validated

✅ **Role-based access control (RBAC)**
- Admin role required for sensitive operations
- Moderator role for content moderation
- Proper middleware enforcement

### Input Validation
✅ **UUID validation**
- All clip IDs validated as proper UUIDs
- Invalid format returns 400 Bad Request

✅ **Vote value validation**
- Only -1, 0, 1 accepted
- Invalid values rejected with clear error message

✅ **Limit constraints**
- Page limit enforced (1-100)
- Page number validated (min: 1)
- Proper default values

✅ **Required field validation**
- Deletion reason required for admin actions
- Vote value required for vote operations

### SQL Injection Prevention
✅ **Parameterized queries**
- All database queries use parameter binding
- No string concatenation for SQL
- pgx library provides safe parameter handling

Example:
```go
query := `SELECT * FROM clips WHERE id = $1`
r.pool.QueryRow(ctx, query, clipID)
```

### Rate Limiting
✅ **Endpoint-specific limits**
- Vote endpoint: 20 requests/minute
- Comment endpoint: 10 requests/minute
- Submit clip: 5 requests/hour

### Data Protection
✅ **Soft deletes**
- Data retained for audit trail
- Removed clips hidden from public views
- Admin actions trackable

✅ **Sensitive data handling**
- Passwords not involved (OAuth only)
- User emails optional
- Personal data properly scoped

### API Security
✅ **CORS configuration**
- Proper CORS middleware
- Controlled origins

✅ **Error handling**
- No sensitive information in error messages
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Consistent error format

✅ **Cache security**
- User-specific data not cached
- Cache keys properly scoped
- No sensitive data in cache keys

## Potential Security Considerations

### Low Risk Items
1. **Admin action logging** - Currently not implemented
   - Recommendation: Add audit logging for admin operations
   - Impact: Low (actions are trackable in database)

2. **View tracking by IP** - Not implemented yet
   - Recommendation: Track view counts with IP deduplication
   - Impact: Low (current implementation is acceptable)

### No Risk Items
- ✅ SQL injection: Protected by parameterized queries
- ✅ XSS: Not applicable (API only, no HTML rendering)
- ✅ CSRF: Not applicable (stateless JWT auth)
- ✅ Authentication bypass: Proper middleware enforcement
- ✅ Authorization bypass: Role checks implemented
- ✅ Mass assignment: Field whitelisting in place

## Security Best Practices Followed

1. ✅ **Principle of least privilege**
   - Users can only access their own votes/favorites
   - Admin operations require elevated roles

2. ✅ **Defense in depth**
   - Multiple layers: validation, authentication, authorization
   - Rate limiting prevents abuse

3. ✅ **Secure by default**
   - Authentication required where needed
   - Soft deletes preserve data
   - Proper default values

4. ✅ **Fail securely**
   - Errors don't expose system details
   - Invalid input rejected early
   - Proper error responses

## Recommendations for Production

### Required Before Deployment
None - All critical security measures implemented

### Recommended Enhancements
1. **Admin audit logging** - Log all admin actions with timestamps and reasons
2. **IP-based view tracking** - Deduplicate view counts by IP address
3. **Monitoring alerts** - Alert on unusual voting patterns or rate limit violations

### Ongoing Security
1. **Regular dependency updates** - Keep Go modules up to date
2. **Security scanning** - Run CodeQL on every commit
3. **Access log review** - Monitor for suspicious patterns
4. **Rate limit tuning** - Adjust based on real usage patterns

## Compliance Notes

### GDPR Considerations
- User data minimization: Only essential data stored
- Right to deletion: Soft delete + hard delete capability exists
- Data portability: API provides JSON responses
- Consent: OAuth-based authentication

### Data Retention
- Clips: Soft deleted, can be purged later
- Votes: Retained for karma calculation
- Favorites: User-controlled, can be removed
- View counts: Aggregated, not personally identifiable

## Security Testing Performed

✅ **Static analysis** - CodeQL scan passed
✅ **Input validation testing** - Unit tests cover edge cases
✅ **Authentication testing** - Middleware properly enforces auth
✅ **Authorization testing** - Role checks validated
✅ **SQL injection testing** - Parameterized queries verified

## Conclusion

The Clip Management API implementation follows security best practices and has passed all security scans. The system is **secure and ready for production deployment**.

**Risk Level:** ✅ LOW

All critical security controls are in place. Recommended enhancements are for improved auditability and do not impact core security posture.
